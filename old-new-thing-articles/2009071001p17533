        I had occasion to meet up with the same family whose two-year-old was  learning to lie in an earlier story. It was only a day or two after the death of Michael Jackson, and the older sister (five years old) told me, “Did you know? Michael Jackson, he went to sleep and he is never going to wake up.”
 Her younger sister (now three), corrected her.
 “No, he’s dead!”
