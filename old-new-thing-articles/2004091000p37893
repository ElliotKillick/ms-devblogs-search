        Scotland doesn’t have the corner on monsters in lakes. You’ll also find them  in Norway,  in Sweden (read about a recent expedition), and  in Canada, among many, many others. Anywhere there are lakes, there’s bound to be a legend about a monster in one of them.
 It appears, however that  Sweden’s Storsjöodjur is about to lose its protected species status, owing to an inquiry inspired by  a man’s request to harvest the creature’s eggs so he can hatch them. 
 As a result, it will soon be open season on Storsjöodjuret. Happy hunting. 
 (I find the Swedish word odjur somewhat poetic. It translates as “monster” but literally means “un-animal”.)
