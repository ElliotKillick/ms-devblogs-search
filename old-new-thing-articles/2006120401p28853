         Although the function WinMain is documented in the Platform SDK, it’s not really part of the platform. Rather, WinMain is the conventional name for the user-provided entry point to a Windows program. 
 The real entry point is in the C runtime library, which initializes the runtime, runs global constructors, and then calls your WinMain function (or wWinMain if you prefer a Unicode entry point).
