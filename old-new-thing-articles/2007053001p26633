         One of my friends is involved with  Science on Tap, a free, informal monthly get-together in the Seattle area covering science topics for the general public. (Recent coverage in the Seattle-PI.) The topic for July 30th is “The three things you need to know about tsunamis”, and a title like that pretty much sells itself.
