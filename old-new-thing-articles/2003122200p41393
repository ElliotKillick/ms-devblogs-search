        According to Aftonbladet, “Gathering Stockholm’s finest news from overheard conversations on the street corner”, En av fem stjäl sin julgran. (“One in five steals their Christmas tree.”) This of course comes from a highly scientific online reader poll. The question is, “How do you get your Christmas tree?” and the response categories are (from top to bottom, with percentages as of 2:31pm PST): “Buy” (35.7%), “Cut with permission” (13.2%), “Cut without permission” (14.3%), “Steal from some other source” (6.1%), “Get from some other source” (4.1%) and “Don’t have a tree” (26.7%).
