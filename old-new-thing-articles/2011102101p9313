         One of my former colleagues tipped me off to  this video of the Grand Opening of the newest Microsoft Store, specifically calling out  this moment at timecode 0:48 of a curtain dropping, revealing cheering employees dressed in Windows colors, which seemed familiar, somehow. 
 Oh right, because  I did the same thing over fifteen years ago, at  timecode 5:25 in this video.
