        While in Seattle-Tacoma International Airport yesterday, waiting for my flight to eventually be cancelled due to weather, then waiting for a replacement itinerary (um, the weather is the same at the destination; doesn’t matter which plane you take), then waiting for the replacement to be cancelled also (wow imagine that), I heard an announcement on the public address system: “Will passenger  Michael Kinsley please pick up a white courtesy phone.”
 Probably the closest I will get to Michael Kinsley.
 Last year, while waiting in I think it was LAX or possibly DEN, I heard the announcement “Will passenger  Larry Ellison please pick up a white courtesy phone.”
