whether
the Explorer feature that shows the column headers in all views
was a rogue feature or a planned one.


If it was a rogue feature, it was a horribly badly hidden one.


One of the important characteristics of the rogue feature is that
you not be able to tell that the feature is there unless you go
looking for it.
If the feature is right there on the screen as soon as you
open an Explorer window,
odds are that somebody is going to notice and say something about it.
(For example,
the designer who is responsible for Explorer is probably going
to notice that every screenshot of Explorer doesn‚Äôt match the spec.)


That‚Äôs why rogue features typically take the form of

a hotkey or

holding a modifier key in conjunction with another
operation.


Writing up this characterization of rogue features reminds
me that I myself am responsible for a rogue feature of Windows¬†95.
If you go to an MS-DOS box, select Edit, then Mark,
then select a section of the window for copying,
if you hold the Ctrl key while dragging the mouse,
the shape of the selection changes from a box to,
um, I‚Äôm not sure the shape has a name.
But it includes all the text between the start point and the end point,
as if the contents of the window had come from an edit control.
Something like this:


xxxxxxxxXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXxxxxxxxxxxxxx


Since this was a rogue feature, it was never tested,
and I suspect that it didn‚Äôt work on Hebrew or Arabic systems.


I must‚Äôve chickened out, or maybe my rogue feature was found out,
because the code for streamed selections was ifdef‚Äôd out
before Windows¬†95 shipped.
So at least I can still honestly say that I never shipped a rogue feature.
