        One of my friends bought me a souvenir one one of his trips to Germany. It is a beer mug from Bayerischer Bahnhof, a restaurant and brewery at the  Leipzig Bayerischer Bahnhof. The mug carries the brewery’s slogan In vollen Zügen genießen, which is a German idiom meaning “to enjoy to the fullest.” Literally, “Das Leben in vollen Zügen genießen” means “to enjoy life in full gulps”, the idea being that instead of sipping your way through life, you’re taking huge gulps of it.
 The slogan is a pun, though, for the Bayerischer Bahnhof, because the word Zug also means train. They come from the root ziehen which means “to pull”. (Compare the English word draught, which has a similar duality.)
 Therefore, the saying “Das Leben in vollen Zügen genießen” could also be interpreted as saying “Enjoy life in crowded trains.”
 Which is why it’s the slogan of a brewery in a train station.
