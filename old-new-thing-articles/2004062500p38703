          After over half a year of eluding experts,    the Hong Kong crocodile was caught at last.  What amused me was that the article said that the creature  had eluded an expert crocodile hunter from Australia  named…    John Lever?  (Curiously,    in this article, he is given credit for capturing the croc.)  
  Not the self-proclaimed Crocodile Hunter  Steve Irwin?  Where’s his PR department when he needs them?
