          As I noted last year,  the Dead Sea Scrolls are in Seattle, and in conjunction with the exhibition is  a series of eleven lectures at Town Hall. Tonightâ€™s lecture is  The Dead Sea Scrolls, Jesus & The Da Vinci Code. These lectures are rebroadcast on  The Seattle Channel, and it appears that the city also  makes the video available via streaming media. It takes a few weeks for them to make it to the archive page, though. The first lecture in the series,  Dead Sea Scrolls: Early Judaism and the Births of Christianity just went up. Fascinating stuff.
