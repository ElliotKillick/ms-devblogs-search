        My mom saw that her friend was wearing a new watch. 
Her friend said, “It also counts how many steps I took today, keeps track of my exercise, even monitors my sleep.” 
My mom replied, “I used to have a watch, but its battery died after only two years! It’s such a hassle replacing the battery.” 
Her friend answered, “Oh, you just recharge it every few days. It’s called a FitBit.” 
My mom said, “Wow, it recharges. So you never need to replace the watch battery. How much did it cost?” 
“Around $150.” 
My mom said, “Whoa, that’s a really expensive watch. Mine was only $15.” 
Hey mom, you know what else is an even more expensive watch? 
A BMW.
