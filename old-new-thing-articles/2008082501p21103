         I was in San Francisco this weekend for a wedding. The flower girl was the bride’s two-year-old niece, and when you add a two-year-old to the wedding party, you never know what’s going to happen, because two-year-olds don’t understand the world the same way adults do.
 During the  unity candle ceremony, the two-year-old pushed her way to the table, joining the bride and groom, in order to get a front-row seat for the ritual. And then when the unity candle was lit, she tried to blow it out. 
 Because when you’re two years old, the only time you see people make a big deal about lighting a candle is when it’s atop a birthday cake, and you know what to do with birthday candles!
