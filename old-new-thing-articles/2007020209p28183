        The ironic thing about fixing a bug, or at least once I mention on this web site that I fixed a particular bug, is that people immediately  complain that I  didn’t fix  some other bug. One school of complaint believes that cosmetic bugs should be fixed first: “You suck. I mean, look at these egregious cosmetic bugs. If you can’t get even those right, then obviously you can’t get the other stuff right either.” The opposite school believes that cosmetic bugs should be fixed last: “You suck. I mean, why are you fixing cosmetic bugs when there are these other bugs!”
 But at least both camps agree on one thing: I suck.
 I think I’d be better off if I said I didn’t fix any bugs at all.
