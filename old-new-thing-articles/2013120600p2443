         A customer had a simple question: “Is it wrong to call SHFile­Operation from a service?” 
 I don’t know if I’d call it wrong, but I’d call it highly inadvisable. 

     SHFile­Operation was designed for interactive operations,     so you’re using it outside its original design parameters. 
     Many shell extensions ignore “no UI” flags and put up UI anyway.     As a result, your call to SHFile­Operation     may end up getting stuck on unexpected UI.     Now you have a service displaying UI,     and that’s just          asking for trouble. 
     The shell for the most part          does not expect to be called while impersonating.     There are a few functions specifically designed for use     while impersonating;     those exceptions are called out explicitly     in their respective documentation.     SHFile­Operation is not one of those functions. 
     Since SHFile­Operation uses the shell namespace,     you are at risk of loading shell extensions into a service.     Shell extensions typically are not written with the     strict security requirements of a service in mind,     and you may end up creating a security hole.     Somebody could plant a     desktop.ini into a directory your service operates on,     and now your service has been tricked into loading     a shell namespace extension.     The bad guys are constantly searching for     buggy shell extensions that they     can use as an attack point.     And if they can get into a service, well, then     they just hit the jackpot!
