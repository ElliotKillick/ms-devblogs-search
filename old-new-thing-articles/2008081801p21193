        When a theater or concert performance begins, there is often an announcement asking audience members to  silence their cell phones and similar devices. Some time ago, a light blinked near the ear of a gentleman a few rows in front of me throughout the entire performance. I couldn’t tell what it was for sure, but it appeared to be the indicator light of a Bluetooth headset.
 Blink. 
 Five seconds later: 
 Blink. 
 Five seconds later: 
 Blink. 
 Repeat for two hours. 
 What I want to know is, was this guy expecting a call during the show? If his phone rang, would he answer it from his seat? 
 (Added: This was before Bluetooth headsets were in common use. It wasn’t until after the show that I was able to guess what it was.)
