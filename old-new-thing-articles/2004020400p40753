        The Glass Engine is an interactive guide to the music of Philip Glass, organized by… um… at least they’re organized. By something.
Bizarre yet oddly compelling.
(Perhaps if we ask nicely, we can get Marc Miller to tell the story of the time he actually met Philip Glass…)
In a similar vein, a friend of mine directed me to Ishkur’s Guide to Electronic Music, an attitude-filled tour of the world of of electronic music.
 I’d like to say that I learned something, but that would be overstating it.
