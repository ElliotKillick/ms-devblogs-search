         Perhaps you’ve seen this quote attributed to Albert Einstein: 
 As a young man, my fondest dream was to become a geographer. However, while working in the Customs Office, I thought deeply about the matter and concluded that it was far too difficult a subject. With some reluctance, I then turned to physics as an alternative. 
 Well, it’s a fake. The original research and debunking  came from Jerry Dobson, then was picked up (with extensive excerpts—recommended) by  Sharon Burnside and then  Regret the Error, which is where I found it.
