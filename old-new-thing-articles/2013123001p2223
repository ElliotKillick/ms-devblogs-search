         I dreamed that through a friend, I got to join a handful of other people atop Prince Charles’s carriage as it wound its way through London. There was no seating up there, so you just have to hang on for dear life. When we reached Buckingham Palace, the assembled crowd and reporters swarmed the carriage for an opportunity to meet the Prince. This provided a sufficient diversion to allow us to climb down from the roof and sneak into the palace undetected. 
 We’ve come to the end of the year, so that’s all for Monday dream blogging. For those of you who hated it: You can uncover your eyes now.
