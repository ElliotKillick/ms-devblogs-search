        For a while,  our cafeteria was trying to sell three-packs of bottled water. A sign proudly announced:

Drink more water: What you should know about H2O
  Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Make it easy. Carry a bottle of water when you commute to work or run errands. 

 This is what I should know about H2O? 
 “Drink more water”:  Notice that they didn’t specify a target amount. Just drink more. 
 “Carry a bottle of water when you commute”: I should drive with one hand on the wheel and the other hand clutching a bottle of water? Isn’t that dangerous? 
 And who is providing this “helpful” information?

 Hardly an impartial organization.
