          Norman Diamond noted in a comment  that on Windows 2003 Server, the Display Adapter Troubleshooting  slider still lists “full acceleration” as the recommended setting  even though the default for Server is “full minus one”.
This is one of those “Oh, that’s an easy change” bugs.  The discussion probably went like this:
Some guy whose idea this was:  “For stability reasons, we want to lower the default video acceleration  for Server a notch.  Dear Video Setup team, can you do that for us?”
Video Setup team: “Sure thing, that’s no problem.  The default setting is all done by us; it should not have any impact  on anybody else. We’ll just do it and be done with it.”
Guy: “Sweet. Thanks.”
And bingo, the default video acceleration dropped to one notch below full  on Server, and everyone was happy.
Except that there’s this text tucked away in the Display control panel  that has the word “(recommended)” next to “full acceleration”.  That didn’t get updated.  Oops.  (I wouldn’t be surprised if there is also some  help text that didn’t get updated for this change.)
No code is an island.
  So when you complain, “Aw come on, it’s a one-line change.  What’s taking so long?” think about the little video acceleration slider.
