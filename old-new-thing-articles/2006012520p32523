        Vancouver technologist  Darren Barefoot was  invited to Redmond by the MSN Search team but was  stopped by Immigration and denied entry.
 Ultimately, the customs agents concluded that because Microsoft was covering my flight and accommodation, I was being compensated for consulting activities. In order to enter the country, I’d need a work permit. 
 He says Customs, but I’m pretty sure it was really Immigration that stopped him.
 Sorry, Darren. We miss you already. We even  asked the rain to take a few days off and invited the sun out to play just for you.
