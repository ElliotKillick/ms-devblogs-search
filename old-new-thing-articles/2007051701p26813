          Store Wars is a propaganda video for the Organic Trade Association, starring vegetables and bad puns. (“Darth Tater” indeed.) Yes, it’s a propaganda video, but at least it’s an entertaining propaganda video. 
 The same company also created  The Meatrix, in conjunction with (deep breath now) the Global Resource Action Center for the Environment. The difference is that The Meatrix isn’t funny.
