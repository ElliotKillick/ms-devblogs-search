        Saturday afternoon, my phone rings.
 “Hello?”
 “Quick! We’re on our way to the nursery.  Do you want to come?”
 I recognize the voice as one of my friends who recently bought a house and presumably is doing some spring landscaping. But I have to answer fast. Time for a snap decision.
 “No.”
 My friend seems surprised that I give my answer so quickly.
 “Oh! Well then! Bye.”
 If you tell me I have to answer fast, you shouldn’t act all offended if I give a quick answer.
