        There’s this software services company that retweets content from various technology sites, and they end every one with “Want to learn more? Call us at…”. What, so they know more about the subject matter than the person whose content they are retweeting? Why would I call them to learn more about myself?

Note that a casual glance at the format of the given phone number may make you think it’s a United States/Canadian number, but it’s not, so readers in the United States should be careful: It likely won’t be covered by your “free national long distance” plan. 
Maybe I should record a One Dev Minute video about a problem that stumped me, and then I can send them an email and ask for the solution!
