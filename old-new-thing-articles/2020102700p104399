        Some time ago, I discussed  the historical significance of the Burgermaster drive-in restaurant. This triggered a memory from one of my colleagues:
I also heard that the BurgerMaster was identified by an ordinal value, and that ordinal value was the telephone number of the restaurant.
 That sounds like a fun story. Alas, it doesn’t hold up.
The Get­Proc­Address function checks the numeric value of the string pointer it is given. If it is greater than or equal to 65536, then it is interpreted as a string pointer. But if it is less than 65535, then it’s treated as an ordinal. Therefore, ordinal values are limited to 65535. That’s not enough digits to hold a U.S. telephone number.
The Global­Master­Handle function was exported as ordinal 28. There does not appear to be any significance to this number. It was just the next available ordinal in the block assigned to global memory functions.
