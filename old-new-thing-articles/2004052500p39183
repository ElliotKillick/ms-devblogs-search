        According to  the Chicago Division,

  Use of the NAME, INITIALS, or SEAL of the F*I  is restricted by law  and may be used only with written permission of the F*I.   

  Asterisks inserted to avoid being arrested by the F*I  for using their name and initials without written permission.
  (I hope they donâ€™t go after me for    using their initials without permission late last year.)
