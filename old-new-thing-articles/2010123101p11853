     Researchers into memory decay in the context of happiness     have determined that          Disneyland is the worst place on earth,     but yet everybody remembers it as a wonderful happy place.     How can that be?     (You gotta watch this video just for the Christmas letter.) 
          When summer fun turns deadly serious:          Jeff Wise,     author of          Extreme Fear: The Science of Your Mind in Danger     shares an experience that shows how the realization that a situation     has become potentially fatal paralyzes otherwise-intelligent people.

(Related:          Anti-Corruption Efforts in Russia Fall Short.)     (Greece-inspired story:     A colleague of mine told me that he had to help a friend of his     make an online purchase because the company refused to accept     credit cards issued by Greek banks.          That’s pretty bad.) 
          How low did we go?:     A look at the (hopefully no-longer-current) fad of          scantily-clad baristas.

     August 25:          Into the land of the Kims – a journey in North Korea.     Taking a guided tour of North Korea (because unguided tours are right out).     
     August 26:          What to do with a stuffed Nicaraguan crocodile.     A visit to Kim Jong-il’s palace of random stuff received as gifts     from foreigners (not just foreign leaders),     formally known as the International Friendship Exhibition.

          Fanciful fruit fly gene names will become boring.     So much for          Cheap Date. 
          Reasoning with Vampires:     The Twilight series, as annotated by an editor. 
          Unearthing Mendelssohn’s Lost Works.     The excerpt from the Italian Symphony reminds me of a book I     discovered some decades ago which provided mnemonic     “lyrics” to major classical works.     The so-called lyrics to the opening of the     Italian Symphony, as best I can remember them, are as follows:     
     Spaghetti! Spaghetti! The meal of Milan,     With oregano and sourdough and veal parmesan.     We eat it by night, we it it by day,     We eat it at work, we eat it at play     And we never get tired,       No, we never get tired,       Of the meal,       Yes, the meal,       From Milano.     
     Catchy, ain’t it. 
     The          Seattle Bubble     real estate blog asks,     “What’s wrong these photos?” 
     I’m not the only one with          a long posting queue.     So remember that the next time you see a strange coincidence     between an article that comes out of my queue and the date it appears. 

 And, as always, the obligatory plug for my column in  TechNet Magazine: 

          Beware the Balloon. 
          Hiding in Plain Sight. 
          History—the Long Way Through.     In their zeal to make this article meet length, the editors cut     what I consider to be the most important part of the article!     Here’s the penultimate paragraph in its full unedited version,     with the important part underlined.     
     But wait, there’s still more.     What if you want to access the real 64-bit system directory     from a 32-bit process?     File system redirection will take your attempt to access the     C:\Windows\System32 directory and redirect it to the     C:\Windows\SysWOW64 directory.     Programmatically, you can use functions with unwieldy names like     Wow64­Disable­Wow64­Fs­Redirection,     but those disable redirection for all operations until re-enabled,     which causes trouble if you’re doing anything more complicated     than opening a single file,     because a complex operation may result in multiple files being     accessed and possibly even worker threads being created.     Instead of using a gross switch like disabling file system redirection,     you can use the special C:\Windows\SysNative virtual directory.     When a 32-bit process tries to access the C:\Windows\SysNative     directory, the operations are redirected to the real     C:\Windows\System32 directory.     A local solution to a local problem.     

          Leftovers from Windows 3.0. 
          The Story of Restore. 
          The Tumultuous History of ‘Up One Level’.     The editors messed up the diagram in this article.     The “1” is supposed to be an “open folder” icon,     but due to the same error that results in          that mysterious J,     the Wingdings glyph turned into a plain “1”.     Here’s what the diagram was supposed to look like.     (Of course, if your browser is one who believes that     Wingdings doesn’t have a “1” glyph, then you’ll just see a “1”.)     

     So for those of you looking for your Up One Level button,     it’s right there on the Address Bar.     I’ve drawn a box around it so it’s easier to see.
