         In the month after DirectX 3 was released, “directx” became the number one most-searched-for term on microsoft.com. That in itself wasn’t too surprising. What was more surprising was the word in sixth place: “sex”. 
 That puzzles me to this day. What kind of people search for “sex” on microsoft.com? And what were they expecting to find?
