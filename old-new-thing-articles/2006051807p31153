Although the redirection operator traditionally appears at the end
of a command line, there is no requirement that it do so.
All of these commands are equivalent:


echo A B>C
echo A>C B
echo>C A B
>C echo A B


All of them echo “A B” to the file “C”.


You can use this trick to avoid

the redirection problem we discussed last time.
We saw that writing


set message=Meet at 2
echo %message%>schedule


inadvertently interprets the “2” as part of the redirection operator.
One solution was to insert a space:


echo %message% >schedule


but this assumes that the space won’t cause a problem.
If you’re in a case where that space will indeed cause a problem,
you can use the trick above to move the redirection operator
to a location where it won’t cause any trouble:


>schedule echo %message%
