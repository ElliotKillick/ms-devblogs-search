         In a Lisbon grocery store, I was looking at the ingredient panel of a box of cereal. It contained the information in multiple languages, and French came first. I was momentarily stunned by the following warning: 
 Traces possibles d’arachides. 
 I guess this falls in the category of “Raymond misreads French cereal box warnings.”
