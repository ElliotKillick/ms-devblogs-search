         In response to the recent passing of chess celebrity Bobby Fischer, the Associated Press published an article titled  Excerpts from Fischer-Spassky Games. The article consists of excerpts from the organizationâ€™s coverage of the so-called Match of the Century in 1972. 
 But given the title, I wondered whether the article had merely gone like this: 

 Game 3: 27. Qd2 Rbe8 28. Re3 h5 29. R3e2 Kh7 30. Re3 Kg8 
 Game 6: 17. Be2 Nd7 18. Nd4 Qf8 19. Nxe6 fxe6 

 There you go, excerpts from Fischer-Spassky games.
