        Here is where Raymond gets to abuse his power as a blogger  to get some free travel advice.
  I will likely travel to Sweden in mid-March,  with a whopping total of five months of Swedish under my belt.  I’m sure I will embarrass myself horribly,  but that’s sort of the point, after all.
  The question is, “So what’s to do in Sweden?”  I was thinking of flying in to Stockholm,  spending the first day recovering from jet lag,  then spending maybe a week exploring whatever there is  to see there.  (Well, I’ll actually be staying with a friend in Uppsala,  but there appears to be regular train service to/from Stockholm.)  Definitely hit  Vasamuseet,  Nobelmuseet,  and Gamla Stan.  I’m sure there’s other stuff too.
  Then I figure I’d hop a train to Göteborg  and spend the remaining three days there doing,  um, I have no idea. But I’m told it’s a nice city.
  Yes, this plan means that I miss out on Gotland,  Skåne, the -Köppings, and all the northern bits.  But then again, you can’t see a whole country in just ten days.
  So am I nuts?
