        This upcoming Sunday is Mother’s Day in the United States, and I’m reminded of a little story from several years ago.
 One day, we asked a colleague how he and his new child were planning to celebrate Mother’s Day.
 “Yup, I’m all over that. I mailed a gift to my mother earlier this week, and I’ll call her on Sunday.”
 — Um, aren’t you forgetting somebody?
 “I’m not sure what you’re talking about.”
 — What about your wife Betty?
 A beat.
 “I should do something for Betty’s mother?”
 Let this be a cautionary tale for new fathers.
