It is possible to create an infinitely recursive directory tree.
This throws many recursive directory-traversal functions into disarray.
Here’s how you do it.  (Note: Requires NTFS.)


Create a directory in the root of your C: drive, call it C:\C,
for lack of a more creative name.
Right-click My Computer and select Manage.
click on the Disk Management snap-in.


From the Disk Management snap-in, right-click the C drive
and select “Change Drive Letter and Paths…”.


From the “Change Drive Letter and Paths for C:” dialog,
click “Add”, then where it says
“Mount in the following empty NTFS folder”,
enter “C:\C”.  Click OK.


Congratulations, you just created an infinitely recursive directory.

Go ahead and add as many “\C”s as you like.  You’ll just get your own
C drive back again.


Okay, now that you’ve had your fun,
go back to the
“Change Drive Letter and Paths for C:” dialog and Remove
the “C:\C” entry.
Do this before you create some real havoc.


Now imagine what happens if you had tried a recursive treecopy
from that mysterious C:\C directory.
Or if you ran a program that did some sort of recursive operation
starting from C:\C, like, say, trying to add up the sizes of all
the files in it.


If you’re writing such a program, you need to be aware of reparse
points (that thing that shows up as <JUNCTION> in the
directory listing).
You can identify them because their file attributes include the
FILE_ATTRIBUTE_REPARSE_POINT flag.
Of course, what you do when you find one of these is up to you.
I’m just warning you that these strange things exist and if you
aren’t careful, your program can go into an infinite loop.
