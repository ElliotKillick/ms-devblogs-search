        I love it when two unrelated stories conspire to create amusement beyond what each one provided separately.
We start with this report from BoingBoing of a man on Craigslist who offered to perform computer maintenance and repair in exchange for second base. (For those not familar with North American high school sexual slang—and that includes me—I refer you to this schedule of bases on Wikipedia, accompanied by a disturbingly elaborate list of secondary metaphors.)
That story provided momentary amusement, but it was subsequently recalled by this unrelated story of a man who was ruled to have been overcharged for breast fondling. If only he’d known to offer to back up their PC instead.
