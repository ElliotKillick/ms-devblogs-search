        At Microsoftâ€™s consulting divisions, customer visits are a part of the job. A shorthand has developed to describe how formally dressed you should be at the meeting with the customer.

Suited and booted: Business suit including necktie. 
Business casual: Collared shirt and trousers (no jeans). 
Microsoft casual: Jeans and a t-shirt. 

 (I leave it as an exercise to develop the comparable attire for women.) 
 Note: This Microspeak entry was submitted by a colleague from the UK, so it may be peculiar to the UK dialect of Microspeak.
