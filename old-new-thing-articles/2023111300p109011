        This is the counterpart article to  What’s the difference between UuidFromString, IIDFromString, CLSIDFromString, GUIDFromString….
Here’s the table:



Function
Output


Buffer management
Character set support


Uuid­To­String
xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx


Free with Rpc­String­Free
ANSI and Unicode


String­From­IID
{xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx}


Free with Co­Task­Mem­Free
Unicode only


String­From­CLSID
{xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx}


Free with Co­Task­Mem­Free
Unicode only


String­From­GUID2
{xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx}


Provided by caller
Unicode only



Since the size of a stringized GUID/UUID/IID is fixed, String­From­GUID2 is probably the most convenient function to use, since you can just have it generate the string into its final destination.
