For

many

years,
I’ve

put together
a

little pocket guide

to the Seattle Symphony

subscription

season
for my symphony friends to help them decide which
ticket package they want.
For a few years now, we haven’t ordered any tickets at all
because we all have young children,
but I still make this guide out of some sense of obligation.


So here’s the
at-a-glance season guide for the 2014/2015 season anyway,
again with no comments from me because nobody I know is going
to use them to decide which tickets to order.
Besides, you can probably preview nearly all of the pieces
nowadays
(minus the premieres) by searching on YouTube.


Here is

the official brochure for those who want to read the details,
and you can see

what The Seattle Times thinks of it.

function filter(c)
{
 var rows = document.getElementById(“schedule”).getElementsByTagName(“TR”);
 for (var i = 0; i != rows.length; i++) {
  var row = rows[i];
  var className = row.className;
  if (className != “”) {
   if (c == ‘all’ || className.indexOf(c) >= 0) {
    row.style.display = “”;
   } else {
    row.style.display = “none”;
   }
  }
 }
}

For those not familiar with the Seattle Symphony ticket package line-ups:
Most of the ticket packages are named Masterworks nX where
n is
the number is the number of concerts in the package, and the letter
indicates which variation.
Ticket packages have been combined if they are
identical save for the day of the week.
For example, 7C and 7D are the same concerts;
the only difference is that 7C is for Thursday nights, while 7D is
for Saturday nights.


The WolfGang series is available only to members of the

WolfGang club.
It also includes one concert not listed in the chart above:
The Movie Music of John Williams.


This chart doesn’t include concert series such
as the Mozart Concertos or Distinguished Artists series
which share no concerts with any of the Masterworks concerts.


Notes and changes:


The 7[AB], 7[CD], and 7[EF] concert series do not overlap,
    so you can create your own 14-concert series
    by taking any two of them,
    or recreate the 21-concert series by taking all three.
The 13-concert series is the same as the 7[CD]
    and 7[EF] series combined, minus the
    November 13 concert.
The non-Masterworks series line-up has been tweaked.
    The Mozart series is now a concerto series,
    and there is a Sunday Untuxed series for families.
The Sunday Untuxed series
    squeezes out the
    the Behind the Score series,
    though there is a one-shot Behind the Score
    concert for Sibelius’s Fifth Symphony.


There are two festivals:
Dvořák and Sibelius.
Although there are no ticket packages specifically
for the
Dvořák or Sibelius concerts,
tickets for the concerts are available individually so you can
make your own festival.


And this year,

they made a promotional video.
