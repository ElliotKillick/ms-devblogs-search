        My niece (two years old at the time) was put in the corner as punishment for some sort of misdeed. At the expiration of her punishment, her grandfather returned and asked her, “你乖唔乖?” (Are you going to be nice?)
 She cheerfully replied, “仲未乖!” (Still naughty!)
 In an unrelated incident, one of my  honorary nieces was being similarly punished. She told her aunt who was passing nearby, “In a little while, my daddy is going to ask me if I’m sorry. I’m not really sorry, but I’m going to say that I am.”
