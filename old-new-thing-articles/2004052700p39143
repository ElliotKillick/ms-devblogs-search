        (Not to be confused with Star Trek’s    Pavel Chekov, who spells his name with a plain “k” instead of a “kh”.  Of course, since this is all    transliteration from Cyrillic,  of which there are  multiple  systems,  arguing about spelling is rather dubious anyway.)
  The guerilla performance group  Improv Everywhere  stages events in public places and carefully records the reaction of  their unwitting “audience”.  Perhaps one of their best-known stunts  is the    appearance of author Anton Chekhov at a New York City Barnes and Noble.
  After the reading, they set up a table in Union Square Park across the street  and sold autographed copies of The Cherry Orchard from a table.  
  The young man in the jean jacket above insisted that  Chekov only sign his autograph,  rather than making it out to anyone in particular.  He proudly announced,  “When you die, this is going to be worth lots of money!”    
  Though I think their best performance from an artistic performance  point of view was  The Moebius.
