          The air must be thinner the higher up the management chain you go,  or maybe it just gives you more opportunities to look stupid.  Like this message:  
  From: <some upper manager>  Subject: <some subject>  
  I will try to keep this relatively brief as I know how busy everyone is.  
  <… 4-page message follows…>  

  If this is brief, I’d hate to see a “somewhat lengthy” message.
