         I found it amusing that somebody considered the fact that Microsoft employees can read my queued-up blog entries before the articles are published to be  further evidence of Microsoft’s evil essence as a monopoly. 
 Just for the record, this is not evidence of Microsoft’s evil essence as a monopoly. Rather, it’s evidence of Raymond’s evil essence as a monopoly, because the monopoly on blog articles written by Raymond Chen that haven’t yet been published belongs to me.
