        Some time ago, I shared some feedback submitted to the developer documentation team about  the removal of the Office cat assistant. I turned it into a reminiscence about Earl the Cat, but let’s return to the most likely Office assistant cat: Links the Cat.
A bug was submitted about Links the Cat complaining that it was “licking itself suggestively”. I don’t know which specific animation the complaint was about, but maybe it was  this one, where Links grooms its leg.
I don’t know long it took to investigate, but the bug was eventually resolved as “By Design” with the comment, “My cat does this.”
