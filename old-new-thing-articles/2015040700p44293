        When a server is taken offline, be it a  planned unplanned outage or an unplanned unplanned outage or something else, the operations team send out  a series of messages alerting customers to the issue.
 Some time ago, I received a notification that went like this:

 Well that clears things up.
 Curiously, the message includes an incident duration but doesn’t have an ETA. Thankfully, the message was sent one minute after the incident was over, so by the time I got it, everything was back to normal.
