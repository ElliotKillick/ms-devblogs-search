         At the Windows 95 Launch and at various other marketing events, guests were given         a copy of “Windows 95 Special Edition”. What is so special about the box?      
         Answer: The box.      
         The contents of the box are exactly the same as a regular copy of Windows 95. The         only thing special about it is the box itself.
