        This is not so much Microspeak as it is Microsoft Real Estate and Facilities-speak. The following notice was displayed in one of the buildings: 

Microsoft Real Estate and Facilities will be converting lab 1234 to a team space. The new space will ease occupant compression. 

Occupant compression? Ouch, that sounds painful. 
The term compression appears to be an actual term of art in the Real Estate and Facilities department. I found a presentation that was rich in citations. 

Power/HVAC programming in per seat basis at #### W/SC results in risk given observed compression behavior. 


We determined the frequency and magnitude that teams in neighborhood spaces compress. 


Some neighborhoods always compress regardless of loading, likely caused by business drivers for proximity. 

From what I can gather, compression is the term used to describe how close together peopleâ€™s workspaces are.
