        A customer found that when they obtained the token to a process with Open­Process­Token and passed that token to Create­Environment­Block, the returned environment variables didn’t match the actual environment variables of the other process. Is Create­Environment­Block broken?
No, Create­Environment­Block is not broken. The thing that’s broken is your expectations.
Nowhere does it say that Create­Environment­Block copies the environment of another process. After all, it’s not called Copy­Process­Environment­Block. Indeed, the handle that you pass to Create­Environment­Block isn’t even a process handle!
What Create­Environment­Block does is create a new environment block for the user specified by the token. This is the mechanism that the system uses to create the initial environment for a user when they log in.
Environment variables are local to a process, and there is no documented way of extracting them. We asked the customer why they needed to extract the environment variables of another process. We never heard back.
