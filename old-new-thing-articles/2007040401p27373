        There’s been a slight change in plans. I will be in Palo Alto on April 23rd  rather than April 20th. Not that anybody is affected by this beyond the folks at Microsoft’s Silicon Valley Campus, since nobody else took me up on my offer. I guess I’m not as popular as I thought.
 Update 13-Apr-2007: Here’s my schedule for April 23rd when I’m down San Jose way.


9:00am –
10:00am:
Brocade

chat


10:30am –
1:00pm:
Google
presentation + lunch chat


1:30pm –
3:00pm:
Apple
chat


3:30pm –
7:00pm:
Microsoft SVC
presentation + chat + dinner


 Now the term “presentation” is a bit of an overstatement. It’s really just me telling a bunch of stories, but instead of sitting at a table with a bunch of people, I’ll be standing in front of a room. Same stories, different audio system. I’ll have a number of stories prepared, but I’m hoping some of the chatter will inspire other stories. (I won’t do a coding presentation because, I mean really, a presentation on Win32 programming topics is bo-ring.)
 Extremely limited guest seating—we’re talking one or two people—may be available at the Apple chat. The other appearances are closed-door. Dinner plans have yet to be settled, but I suspect that’s your better bet. Contact me directly for details (if you haven’t already).
