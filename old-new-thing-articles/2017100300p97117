        Some time ago, I noted that “Building 109 Conference Room A” was a code word for the bar at the Azteca restaurant next to building 109. Alas, that code word is no more, because the Azteca restaurant has been demolished to make way for an apartment complex. 
But when a door closes, a new door opens. I’ve learned that the Chipotle’s next to Amazon’s new downtown Bellevue office “Everest” has been nicknamed Everest Conference Room C.
