 In words, integral types and pointers up to eight bytes in size are stored at their natural alignment. Larger types are stored at eight-byte alignment. 


Type
Alignment


BYTE, char, UCHAR
1-byte alignment


WORD, WCHAR, short,     USHORT
2-byte alignment


DWORD, int, long,     UINT, ULONG, float,     32-bit pointer
4-byte alignment


QWORD, __int64,     unsigned __int64, double, 64-bit pointer
8-byte alignment


 In other words (saying it a third time), let T be an integral or pointer type. If sizeof(T) ≤ 8, then T is aligned at a sizeof(T)-byte boundary. If sizeof(T) ≥ 8, then T is aligned at an 8-byte boundary.
