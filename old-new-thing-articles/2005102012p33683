        I remarked earlier that  the creative director for the PDC rummaged through our offices looking for stuff which was to be used in the opening PDC video to decorate a developer’s cubicle. It all flashed by really quickly, but if you were paying attention, you might have been able to make out the following:

The Art of Computer Programming leaning against the tower. 
Writing Secure Code on the desk. 
Compilers: Principles, Techniques and Tools,     better known as “The Red Dragon Book”, being used as a monitor stand! 
Platters from a broken hard drive used as a decoration. 
My letter of appreciation on the wall next to the whiteboard. 
A forged diploma with my name on it,     also on the wall next to the whiteboard. 

 One thing you won’t find in the developer’s cubicle, however, is a can of soda. That’s because none of the soda companies would give permission for their product to appear in this video. 
 Later in the video, several pages from the web site  tastingmenu.com are flashed across the screen. Puzzle: Why was this site chosen? 
 (For legal reasons, I can’t provide a link to the video. Any comments that claim to include a link to the video will be deleted, sorry.)
