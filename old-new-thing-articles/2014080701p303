        On November 13, 2014 November 14, 2014, Saint Paul, Minnesota will be the home to NotepadConf, which bills itself as “the premier technology conference for Notepad.exe users and text enthusiasts.”
 I’m still not sure  whom Microsoft will send to the conference, but maybe that person could give a talk on how you can  use Notepad to take down the entire Internet.
 Update: The conference has been rescheduled to Friday the 14th.
