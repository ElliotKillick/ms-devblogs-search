        Along the navband on the left hand side is a link to the comment policy. The most significant change since its first release is that I introduced the two-week rule. As a general rule, comments posted more than two weeks after the article publication are eligible for summary deletion. It’s great that you’re all interested n stuff, but having to deal with comments on articles I wrote six months ago is just too much work, especially when the topic drifts far away from the original subject.
Curiously, one person claimed that I closed comments because I was losing an argument.  If you look at the timestamps, I closed comments after four months of inactivity. Everybody had two months to say their piece.
