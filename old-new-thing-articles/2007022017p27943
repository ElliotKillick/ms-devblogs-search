         And who says these college students aren’t getting anything done?  The Princeton University student government announced, among other things, a web site wherein students could list up to five other people they have crushes on, and if two people list each other, the web site puts the two potential lovebirds in touch with each other. The site went online on (appropriately enough) Valentine’s Day, and  student reaction was swift, with over a thousand students signing up before the day was over. 
 You can pay Crush Finder a visit, though since you’re (probably) not a student you can’t actually submit anything, but the gossip in you can check out  the top ten most crushed-on students.
