        In  a comment to yesterday’s entry,  someone asked about the customized icon that appears in the  address bar… sometimes.
  There’s actually method to the madness.  I was going to write about it later, but the comment (and misinformed  answers) prompted me to move it up the schedule a bit.  (The originally-scheduled  topic for today – the history of Ctrl+Z – will have to wait.)
  Each web site can put a customized icon called favicon.ico  into the root of the site,  or    the page can use a custom LINK tag in the HTML to specify a nondefault  location for the favicon, handy if the page author  do not have write permission  into the root directory of the server.
  In order for the favicon.ico to show up in the address bar,  (1) the site needs to offer a customized icon,  (2) you have to have added the site to your favorites,  and (3) the site icon must still be in your IE cache.
  IE does not go and hit every site you visit for a favicon.ico file;  that would put too much strain on the server.  (Heck, some people got hopping mad that IE was probing for favicon.ico  files at all.  Imagine the apoplectic fits people would have had if IE probed  for the file at every hit!)  Only when you add the site to your favorites does  IE go looking for the favicon and stash it in the cache for future use.
