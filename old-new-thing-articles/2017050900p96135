        Jim Lyon shares this story about early Windows phone devices: 
I remember during early development of Windows phones, our solution to the overheating problems. You would get two cans of soda from the fridge, set one on the desk, set the phone on top of that, and set the other on top of the phone. You were then good for an hour or so. We probably had the only liquid-cooled phones on the planet.
