Have you checked out AMD’s ads for their AMD Athlon 64 FX
processor?  The copy reads, “My adrenalin fix isn’t what
it used to be. Double the dose.  AMD me.”
And it has a picture of a tough-looking guy glaring at the camera,
challenging the reader to do their worst.


But take a look at what’s on his screen.  It’s a giant command window.
Now look at what this adrenalin junkie has been typing into his
command window:
