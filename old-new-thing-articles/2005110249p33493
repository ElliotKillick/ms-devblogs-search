        I have no idea  who this person is, but she’s all attitude all the time. Like  this entry from October 18, 2005 when Jennifer was recovering from a foot injury:
  Men love a girl who can’t run away quickly 
 I got “wooey!”-ed by a garbage man on my way back to the office from lunch today… Because I’m so HAWT hobbling down the street. He could not resist my hobbling! I am hobbleicious! Sssssssss! * 
 And just so you know, being followed down the street by a garbage truck with someone screaming “YEAH BABY!” and “what’s your phone number?” is TOTALLY CLASSY! 
 * This is the sound of me sizzling! 

 It’s the asterisk that’s the icing on the cake. 
 From that web site’s blogroll you can springboard to a whole new world of outrageous content. Like  My Boyfriend is a Twat or  Inappropriately Dressed.
