        Not saying how I know these things. Just making a little list for reference.

If you plan on staying dry, do not hold the party near a fountain. (Note that fountain avoidance is a necessary but not sufficient criterion.)
Corollary: If your team members have an armory of super soaker water cannons, and you plan on staying dry, then absolutely do not hold the party near a fountain.
Unrolled spools of bubble wrap are a poor choice of equipment when trying to climb from the lobby to the upper floor balcony.
After discovering that bubble wrap is unsuitable for climbing, do not upend a glass table in an attempt to gain a higher starting point.
A contest to see who can run and break through a plaster wall is not a recommended choice of impromptu amusement.
Do not throw a couch from the upper floor balcony. Not even if itâ€™s on fire.
Costco underwear does not count as swim trunks.
Do not have a tug of war over a vat of Jell-O.
The expensive sculpture outside your building is not a water storage tank in need of refilling.
Exercise caution when driving your motorcycle through the halls. The carpet damage from your burnout can be repaired, but the patches never really look the same.
On the day of the ship party, do not wear a nice suit. You might be thrown into the back of a pick-up truck and buried in ice.

Bonus:  Other lessons learned.
