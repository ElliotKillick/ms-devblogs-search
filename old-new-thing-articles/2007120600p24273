         Some time ago, somebody clicked the “Contact me” link in the navigation bar, and despite the warnings, asked a technical question. I responded, “If you have a question you can post it to the suggestion box.” The reply: 
 Please, don’t use a bot which pretends to be you to answer e-mails. Especially such a poorly-designed one. 
 Maybe those people were right.  Perhaps I’m a robot. (It would certainly be a lot easier for me if I were.)
