        One evening, I had a series of three dreams. In each one, I visited an unusual home.
 In the second dream, I visited the home of a friend of mine. She lived in a modern luxury apartment inside an art museum. It was a little tricky, because you could visit her only during museum hours. If you stayed past closing time, then you were locked inside the museum, and you were spending the night whether you liked it or not.
 On the other hand, it meant that you could go out an view the art to your heartâ€™s content without any crowds.
 And no,  the museum did not come to life. You just got free run of a museum for the night.
