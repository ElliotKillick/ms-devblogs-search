        The folks over at  BuzzFeed Food have put together this marvelous  Essential Guide To Dim Sum. The field guide includes pictures of dim sum offerings, organized by food preparation style, then sub-categorized by physical appearance. Each dish is accompanied by its name in three languages (English, Mandarin Chinese, and Cantonese), along with symbolic information  similar to a clothing care tag that encodes information like recommended method of eating.
 Save some radish cakes for me.
