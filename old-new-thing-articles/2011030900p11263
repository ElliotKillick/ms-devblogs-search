        When debugging, you may find that the stack trace falls apart:

This can’t possibly be the complete stack. I mean, where’s the thread procedure? That should be at the start of the stack for any thread.
What happened is that the EBP chain got broken, and the debugger can’t walk the stack any further. If the code was compiled with frame pointer optimization (FPO), then the compiler will not create EBP frames, permitting it to use EBP as a general purpose register instead. This is great for optimization, but it causes trouble for the debugger when it tries to take a stack trace through code compiled with FPO for which it does not have the necessary information to decode these types of stacks.
Begin digression: Traditionally, every function began with the sequence
        push ebp      ;; save caller's EBP
        mov ebp, esp  ;; set our EBP to point to this "frame"
        sub esp, n    ;; reserve space for local variables

and ended with
        mov esp, ebp  ;; discard local variables
        pop ebp       ;; recover caller's EBP
        ret n

This pattern is so common that the x86 has dedicated instructions for it. The ENTER n,0 instruction does the push / mov / sub, and the LEAVE instruction does the mov / pop. (In C/C++, the value after the comma is always zero.)
if you look at what this does to the stack, you see that this establishes a linked list of what are called EBP frames. Suppose you have the following code fragment:
void Top(int a, int b)
{
 int toplocal = b + 5;
 Middle(a, local);
}

void Middle(int c, int d)
{
 Bottom(c+d);
}

void Bottom(int e)
{
 int bottomlocal1, bottomlocal2;
 ...
}

When execution reaches the ... inside function Bottom the stack looks like the following. (I put higher addresses at the top; the stack grows downward. I also assume that the calling convention is __stdcall and that the code is compiled with absolutely no optimization.)



Top‘s stack frame
 


0040F8F8
parameter b passed to Top
During execution of Top,
←EBP = 0040F8EC


0040F8F4
parameter a passed to Top


0040F8F0
return address of Top‘s caller


0040F8EC
EBP of Top‘s caller


0040F8E8
toplocal


Middle‘s stack frame
 


0040F8E4
parameter d passed to Middle
During execution of Middle,
←EBP = 0040F8D8


0040F8E0
parameter c passed to Middle


0040F8DC
return address of Middle‘s caller


0040F8D8
0040F8EC = EBP of Middle‘s caller


Bottom‘s stack frame
 


0040F8D4
parameter e passed to Bottom
During execution of Bottom,
←EBP = 0040F8CC


0040F8D0
return address of Bottom‘s caller


0040F8CC
0040F8D8 = EBP of Bottom‘s caller


0040F8C8
bottomlocal1


0040F8C4
bottomlocal2



Each stack frame is identified by the EBP value which the function uses during its execution.
The structure of each stack frame is therefore



[ebp+n]
Offsets greater than 4 access parameters


[ebp+4]
Offset 4 is the return address


[ebp+0]
Zero offset accesses caller’s EBP


[ebp-n]
Negative offsets access locals



And the stack frames are all connected to each other in the form of a linked list threaded through the EBP values. This linked list is known as the EBP chain. End digression.
To recover from the broken EBP chain, start dumping the stack a little before things go bad (in this case, I would start at 001af384-80) and then look for something that looks like a valid stack frame. Since the parameters and locals to a function can be pretty much anything, all you have left to work with is the EBP and the return address. In other words, you are looking for pairs of values of the form
«pointer a little higher up the stack».
«code address»

In this case, I got lucky and didn’t have to go very far:

At stack address 001af478, we have a pointer to memory higher up the stack followed by a code address. if you follow that pointer, it points to another instance of the same pattern: A pointer higher up the stack followed by the code address.
Once you find where the EBP chain resumes, you can ask the debugger to resume its stack trace from that point with the =n option to the k command.

When you do this, make sure to ignore the first line of the resumed stack trace, since that is based on your current EIP, not the return address stored in the stack frame.
Today was really just a warm-up for another debugging technique that I haven’t finished writing up yet, so you’re just going to be in suspense for another two years or so, though if you attended  my TechEd China talk, you already know where I’m going.
Bonus reading: In Ryan Mangipano’s two-part series on kernel mode stack overflows,  the second part does a bit of EBP chain chasing. (Feel free to read  the first part, as well as  earlier discussion on the subject of stack overflows.)
