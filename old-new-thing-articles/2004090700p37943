        For some reason, this question gets asked a lot. How do I convert a byte[] to a System.String? (Yes, this is a CLR question. Sorry.)
 You can use  String System.Text.UnicodeEncoding.GetString() which takes a byte[] array and produces a string. 
 Note that this is not the same as just blindly copying the bytes from the byte[] array into a hunk of memory and calling it a string. The GetString() method must validate the bytes and forbid invalid surrogates, for example. 
 You might be tempted to create a string and just mash the bytes into it, but that violates string immutability  and can lead to subtle problems.
