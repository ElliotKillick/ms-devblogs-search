 Wendy’s mother was trying to be helpful, but of course it was a net loss for poor Wendy, who couldn’t find anything in her kitchen for weeks. Yes, there was the whole Oh great where did my mother put my food processor? problem, but even after she found it, the “improved” location was far worse than its original location. In fact, in many cases, it was in the exact opposite location from where it should be.
 You see, Wendy is left-handed, and her mother is right-handed.
