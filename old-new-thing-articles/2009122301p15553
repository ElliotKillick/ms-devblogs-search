         The Washington Post did a spot check of area wine stores and found that of the “shelf talkers” signs (those things that describe the wine and tell you what score it received from Wine Spectator magazine) it found,  a quarter of them were incorrect, usually by attributing a good score to the correct wine vineyard but from a different year. So when you cruise the wine store, make sure to double-check that the information placard actually matches the wine it’s posted next to.
