         Surely by now  you’ve seen the video where NextGenHacker101 shows you how to use the “Tracer T” program to view “how many IP’s are looking at Google”, their name, and connection speed (to then to then to then). (And commenter squizz  explains why it “worked” in spite of the http prefix.)                 
 But more awesome is the fact that somebody ported the video to linux! 
 Bonus video craziness: It’s in Korean but somehow that just adds to the insanity. (Warning: Five minutes of your life you will never get back.) 
 The comments on the YouTube video identify the song as “Bo Peep Bo Peep <- possibly  the most addictive/annoying song ever.”
