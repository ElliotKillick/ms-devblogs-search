         NPR interviewed John Reeves, the artist behind a 160-foot-tall mountain of ice in Alaska. The man has a down-home aw-shucks kind of demeanor that I found quite charming.
  I’m a middle-aged guy that has a lot of time in the winter and a little bit of extra money to play with, so my hobby was to see how big an ice hill I could grow. I started last year as just a way to amuse myself just to see what would happen if you left the water running all winter, and last year’s model was so interesting and so much fun that this year I decided to continue doing it.
  Well, a long winter in Alaska will do that to you, I guess.
 Yes it will. A long, cold, dark… lengthy, cold… did I mention cold?
