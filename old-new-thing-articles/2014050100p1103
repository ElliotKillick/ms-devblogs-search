Commenter Ivo notes that
if you ask
IExtract­Icon::Extract to extract an icon at a
particular size, the function can return
S_FALSE which means
“Go jump in a lake do it yourself.”
But

how can you do it yourself?
The Extract­Icon and
Extract­Icon­Ex functions don’t let you
specify a custom size,
and Load­Image doesn’t work with icon indices
(only resource IDs).


The SH­Def­Extract­Icon function comes to the
rescue.
This takes all the parameters of
IExtract­Icon::Extract
(plus a bonus flags parameter),
and it will actually do an extraction.


Let’s extract an icon from Explorer at 48×48, just for illustration.
As usual, start with our

scratch program, then make these changes:


#include <shlobj.h>
void
PaintContent(HWND hwnd, PAINTSTRUCT *pps)
{
  HICON hico;
  if (SHDefExtractIcon(TEXT("C:\\Windows\\Explorer.exe"),
                       1, 0, &hico, NULL, 48) == S_OK) {
    DrawIconEx(pps->hdc, 0, 0, hico, 0, 0, 0, NULL, DI_NORMAL);
    DestroyIcon(hico);
  }
}


Run the program, and observe that it draws the second icon
from Explorer (whatever it is) at a size of
48×48.
