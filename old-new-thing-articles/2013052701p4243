        I dreamed that I had to fix a bug caused by variable redeclaration inside a nested courtyard. Had to move the horses out of the way first.
 And then it got weird. 
 I won’t go into the orchestra rehearsal that turned out to be just a recording played on a loudspeaker in an empty concert hall. Because you wouldn’t believe that part.
