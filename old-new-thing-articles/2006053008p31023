        I first heard  Ofeibea Quist-Arcton when she reported for the BBC. Now she’s on NPR (you can listen to her discuss  corruption in Nigeria in this recent report), thereby wresting the title of “most mellifluous NPR reporter name” from its previous holder,  Sylvia Poggioli. (Sylvia Poggioli’s dirty secret: She was born and grew up in the United States!)
 Other NPR personalities with cool-sounding names:  Andrei Codrescu,  Mandalit del Barco,  Snigdha Prakash, and  Eric Westervelt.
  Christiane Amanpour has a nice name, too, but she works for CNN, not NPR.
