         There was a morning meeting event at which donuts were provided as an enticement. Someone commented on the food thus: “These donuts failed to meet expectations.” 
 Peter Sagal remarked that the phrase “emerging to standard” has entered currency in his family as a euphemism for “substandard”. (Opening panel round, final question, time code 1:20.) However, the proposal to replace “failed” with “deferred success” was  ultimately defeated.
