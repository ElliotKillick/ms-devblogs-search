Every

year,
I put together a

little pocket guide

to the Seattle Symphony

subscription

season
for my symphony friends to help them decide which
ticket package they want.
As before, you might find it helpful, you might not, but either way,
you’re going to have to suffer through it.
Here’s the at-a-glance season guide for the 2012/2013 season.
(Full brochure.

Seattle Times coverage.)

function filter(c)
{
 var rows = document.getElementById(“schedule”).getElementsByTagName(“TR”);
 for (var i = 0; i != rows.length; i++) {
  var row = rows[i];
  var className = row.className;
  if (className != “”) {
   if (c == ‘all’ || className.indexOf(c) >= 0) {
    row.style.display = “”;
   } else {
    row.style.display = “none”;
   }
  }
 }
}

Premiere


For those not familiar with the Seattle Symphony ticket package line-ups:
Most of the ticket packages are named Masterworks nX where
n is
the number is the number of concerts in the package, and the letter
indicates which variation.
Ticket packages have been combined if they are
identical save for the day of the week.
For example, 7C and 7D are the same concerts;
the only difference is that 7C is for Thursday nights, while 7D is
for Saturday nights.
The Beyond the Score concerts focus on only one of the pieces.
The WolfGang series is available only to members of the

WolfGang club.


This chart doesn’t include “one-off” concert series such
as the Mainly Mozart or Distinguished Artists series.
A “one-off” series is a concert series which shares no concerts
with any other series.


Changes from last season:


The Rush Hour series was redesigned and became the
    Symphony Untuxed series.
Symphony Specials was dropped.
The
    Baroque & Wine Series and
    Mainly Mozart concerts still exist,
    but I dropped them from the table since they are
    now one-off series.
WolfGang already existed but I added it to the list
    now that there’s room for it.



The comments column very crudely categorizes the works
to assist my less-classically-aware friends.
This is, of course, a highly subjective rating system,
but I tried to view each piece from the ears of my symphony friends.
Thus, I rated downward pieces that I personally like
but which others might not and rated up pieces that I may not
find musically satisfying but which nevertheless tend to be
crowd-pleasers.


These predictions have, of course, proven wrong in the past.


Here’s what the comments mean.
Note that they do not indicate whether the piece is significant in
a musicological sense; they’re just my guess as to whether my friends
are going to like it.
(For example,
I know that my friends don’t like minimalism,
and I suspect they don’t like serialism,
so I rated the Adams and Berg down even though I think they’re quite good.
They also don’t like vocal pieces.
On the other hand, it turns out that I overcame my
Bruckner jinx,
so I can at least give the Bruckner a positive score this time.
Let’s just hope it’s

not the Hass edition.)


Awesome: Guaranteed crowd-pleaser.
Excellent: You will definitely like this piece.
Good: You will probably like this piece.
Okay: You may like this piece.
Nervous: I have a bad feeling about this one.
Polarizing: Some people will love it; others will hate it.
Wildcard: I have no idea what will happen.


In many cases, I am not familiar with the piece
and am basing my evaluation on what I know about the composer
(or am just guessing).
