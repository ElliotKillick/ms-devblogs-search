         On our internal blogging discussion mailing list,  John Kennedy explained that he was trying to set up a video blog but somehow he ended up including the entire video into his RSS feed. He managed to fix the problem, but apologized: 
 If the internet is broken, it was my fault. 
 That was funny enough, but  Keith Combs chimed in with some technical advice, and then added, 
 If you manage to break the internet, it wonâ€™t be the first time.
