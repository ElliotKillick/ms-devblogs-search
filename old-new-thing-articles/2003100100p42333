         Attended my first formal Swedish lesson last night. It’s great to recapture the simultaneous         thrill and frustration of trying to have a conversation in a language you don’t really         know.      
         It’s a small class – Swedish isn’t exactly one of the “big-name” languages out there.         I always feel sorry for the student who can’t seem to shake the bad American accent.         I remember in high school, we had a student who spoke German with a thick Midwestern         accent. It was painful to listen to.      
         I thought it was just me, but it seems to be a common trait: When people are learning         their third language and they get stuck, they instinctively fall back, not on their         first language, but on their second. For me, it means that when I can’t find the Swedish         word for something, I substitute the German word. One of my classmates falls back         on Spanish. (Technically, German isn’t my second language, but I never got very good         at the other language before German, so German acts as the de-facto second language.)      
 I’m pretty sure nobody finds this fascinating aside from me…
