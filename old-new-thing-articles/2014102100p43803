Before you ask a question about regular expressions,
you should make sure you and your audience agree on
which regular expression language you are talking about.


Here is a

handy table of which features are supported by
which regular expression language.


You can use that table to solve this customer’s problem:



I have a regular expression that works just fine when I test
it in
〈insert regular expression testing tool, like
RegExr
or

RegexPlanet〉,
but I can’t get it to work in real life.


C:\> findstr /r /c:"a(?!.*b)" file.txt
(prints no results!)
C:\>


My goal is to find all lines that contain an a
not followed anywhere by a b.
