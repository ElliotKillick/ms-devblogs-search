         The Germans is probably the most well-known episode of  Fawlty Towers. Who better than John Cleese, therefore, to release the song  Donâ€™t Mention the War, just in time for the World Cup. The purpose is to mend fences between Britain and Germany, but it might just make things worse, who knows.
