        errors in directory c:\src\blahc:\src\blah\mumbletool : error error: ??????????????? 
I guess the tool doesn’t know what went wrong either. 
Maybe the error message could have been 
errors in directory c:\src\blahc:\src\blah\mumbletool : error error: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
On the other hand, that could very well have been the error message it wanted to print, except that the characters didn’t survive the translation to the OEM code page.
