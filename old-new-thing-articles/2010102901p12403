         Bill Littlefield of NPR’s sports program  Only a Game  interviews Susan Warren about competitive pumpkin-growing. [Direct link – Real format] An excerpt from her book  Backyard Giants was printed in  The Wall Street Journal:  The Race to Break the Squash Barrier, the quest to grow a one-ton pumpkin. I’m fascinated by these subcultures of people obsessed with one thing.
