         Back in 2010,  the so-called God Mode was the hit discovery of the Internet, at least until the next cute cat video made the rounds. If you had stopped by the  Microsoft Visitor Center during that memeâ€™s brief moment in the sun, and wandered into the gift shop, you could have picked up a t-shirt that said {ED7BA470-8E54-465E-825C-99712043E01C} on the front. 
 Of course, if you actually wore that shirt, you would also get stuffed into a locker and have your lunch money stolen from you.
