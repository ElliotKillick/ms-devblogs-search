        The Seattle Times reports that  the National Weather Service is inviting suggestions from the public on what to call the recent windstorm. They’re baffled because “the storm didn’t fall on a holiday.”
 Huh?
 The storm blew in on the evening of the 14th, but its effects weren’t really felt until the morning of the 15th, and the first dark night for everyone was… the first night of Hanukkah, the Festival of Lights. Everybody in the Seattle area was lighting candles and celebrating Hanukkah (mostly unwittingly).
 Gosh, I wonder what we should call this storm? If you have any ideas, send your suggestion to namethewindstorm@noaa.gov.
 (By the way, in case you missed it, here’s the picture of  the house that had ten trees fall on it.)
