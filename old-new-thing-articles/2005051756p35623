        One of my colleagues was unpacking one of those $30,000 quad-processor more-memory-than-you-know-what-to-do-with super-server computers. The kind that require their own electrical substation.
 And it came with an AOL CD.
 It’s like buying a Lexus and finding a 35-cents-off coupon in the glove compartment.
 Apparently, one of the questions AOL tech support asks when people call in complaining that they can’t get their AOL CD to work is, “Do you have a computer?” [Opening Panel Round, second question] because so many people who don’t have computers stick the CD into their stereo or DVD player and can’t get it to work.
