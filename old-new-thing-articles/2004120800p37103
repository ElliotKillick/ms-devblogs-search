        In  an operation straight out of a James Bond movie, a trio of gamblers used a laser range-finder hidden in a mobile phone to predict the likeliest landing spot of a roulette ball, reducing the odds from 37-1 to 6-1.
 Scotland Yard concluded that  they did nothing illegal and were allowed to keep their winnings. 
 I wonder how long itâ€™ll be before this device shows up on Engadget. 
 (Once I discovered that  I was scooped by Slashdot, I figured there was no hurry and held the story for a quiet day.)
