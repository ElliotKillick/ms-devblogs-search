        Last year, I told the story of  overclocking being the source of a lot of mysterious crashes and that some of those overclocked machines were overclocked at the store. These machines came from small, independent shops rather than the major manufacturers.
 Well it looks like that’s about to change.
  Gateway’s FX530 Desktop can be ordered overclocked by the manufacturer. 
 Just say no to DIY overclocking and let us do it for you! We’ll factory overclock your Intel® quad-core processor.4 Yep, you read that right: factory overclock, which is something that most other major PC manufacturers don’t do. 
 We live in interesting times.
