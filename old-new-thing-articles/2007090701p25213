         Digging through my pile of junk, I found a reference to  a fake article in The New Yorker magazine titled My Fake Job that turned out to be (partly) fake itself. Unfortunately, I missed the article the first time around so I didn’t get to see what all the excitement was about, but it sure sounded like a funny article. (Fractionally more details from the article  here.) 
 I understand there are these buildings called “libraries” that keep hard copies of this stuff. Need to make a mental note to check one out someday.
