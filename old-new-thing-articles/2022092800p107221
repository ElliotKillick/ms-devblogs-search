        Wikipedia claims that  the COM textual representation of GUIDs is mixed-endian.
Is it, really?
No, it is little-endian all the way. But if you don’t understand how GUIDs are formed, it might look like some parts are big-endian.
 The parts of a GUID as defined in the specification are



Field
Type


time_low
32-bit integer


time_mid
16-bit integer


time_hi_and_version
16-bit integer


clock_seq_hi_and_reserved
8-bit integer


cloc_seq_low
8-bit integer


node
6-byte MAC address



The GUID structure breaks it down as
struct GUID
{
    uint32_t Data1;
    uint16_t Data2;
    uint16_t Data3;
    uint8_t  Data4[8];
}

Let’s line up the two pieces against each other.



Field
Type
Structure


time_low
32-bit integer
Data1


time_mid
16-bit integer
Data2


time_hi_and_version
16-bit integer
Data3


clock_seq_hi_and_reserved
8-bit integer
Data4[0]


cloc_seq_low
8-bit integer
Data4[1]


node
6-byte MAC address
Data4[2..7]



If you print out each piece of the GUID structure, with hyphens between each part, then you get
33221100-5544-7766-88-99-AA-BB-CC-DD-EE-FF

Notice that everything is still little-endian. We didn’t have to do any byte flipping when printing:
printf("%04x-%04x-%04x-%02x-%02x-%02x-%02x-%02x-%02x-%02x-%02x",
    Data1, Data2, Data3,
    Data4[0], Data4[1], Data4[2], Data4[3],
    Data4[4], Data4[5], Data4[6], Data4[7]);

My guess is that the folks who designed the string format thought there were too many dashes, so they removed the byte dashes, except for the one that separates the clock bytes from the MAC address.
printf("%04x-%04x-%04x-%02x%02x-%02x%02x%02x%02x%02x%02x",
    Data1, Data2, Data3,
    Data4[0], Data4[1], Data4[2], Data4[3],
    Data4[4], Data4[5], Data4[6], Data4[7]);

33221100-5544-7766-8899-AABBCCDDEEFF

The result is that the last two pieces of the stringified GUID look big-endian, but they’re not. They’re just little-endian with some dashes missing.
