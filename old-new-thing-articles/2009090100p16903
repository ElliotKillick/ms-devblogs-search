        Last year, somebody sent out a message to very large group of people describing a change to, well, what it described isn’t important to the story. What’s important is that the message ended with the following sentence:
 If you have questions, please send them to abcdef. 
 If you don’t see why this was a brilliant move, go back and check what that “abcdef” link really does.
 One of my cynical colleagues noted, “Maybe this was intentional. That way, when they get no feedback, they can say, ‘See, this was an awesome decision. Nobody complained!'”
