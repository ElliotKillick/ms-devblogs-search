        When my colleagues discovered that  Seattle bar Spitfire is opening a bar on the main Microsoft campus, a quick game of Name that bar sprung up. (Todd Bishop has his suggestions.)
 Here are some names we came up with: 

          Building 7.     It makes the code phrase     “meeting in Building 7” a reality.     On the other hand, there is          a local bar     which has          already earned the honorary title Building 7. 
          Blue Screen of Drunkenness,     with local drink          Red Ring of Drunkenness. 
          The Ballmer Peak. 
     Stack Overflow. 
     Memory Corruption. 

 Though I suspect they’ll just call it Spitfire. 
 Sidebar: Although alcohol is available at many company-sponsored social events,  there is no pressure to drink an alcoholic beverage, and people don’t even notice one way or the other. (Just like nobody notices that you had the vegetarian appetizers and avoided the meat ones.)
