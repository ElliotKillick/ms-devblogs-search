    Iceland also has         a Christmas goat.         It burned down. 
    The         gallery of interesting musical notation     presents examples of scenarios in which a work     written in Conventional Western Music Notation     gets a little weird, such as     measures with the wrong number of notes in them,     or notes that, upon closer investigation,     must actually be played right-to-left!     (The author specifically excludes works which are     intentionally unplayable or which are otherwise     parodies of musical notation.)     Don’t miss the companion pages         Extremes of Conventional Music Notation     and         Counterexamples in Conventional Music Notation. 
        Love, Love, Peace, Peace:     The perfect Eurovision Song Contest song. 
        McMansion Hell     documents/deconstructs/ridicules the McMansion.     (If you’re new to the phenomenon,         here’s the primer.) 
        Every question in every Q&A session ever. 
    The Katering Show     is a spoof of television cooking shows,     featuring two hosts named Kate     (one of which is allergic to pretty much everything)     and lots of (hilarious) swearing, so be warned.     Their most famous episode is probably     THERMOMIX,     in which the Kates face-off to make risotto,     one using traditional methods, and one using     the high-tech kitchen gadget. 
    Circumventing London building restrictions by         building underground.         Example. 
        Homeopathic medicine recalled for accidentally     containing active ingredient.     I am not making this up. 
        An Open Letter to the Female Hat-Wearing Dog From Go Dog, Go. 
        Misused English terminology in EU publications.     I guess this could be categorized as “EUspeak”. 
        The birth of standard error. 
        The birth of the recursive mutex. 
        Bugs From Hell: Injected Third-party Code + Detours = a Bad Time 
        How the Circle Line rogue train was caught with data. 

And the customary plug for my series of short videos on One Dev Minute: 

        What was Y2K like at Microsoft?     (Also,     and     also also,     and         also also also.) 
        Decoding Windows build numbers 
        What programming language is Windows written in? 
        Error reporting in Windows. 
        How does focus management work?
