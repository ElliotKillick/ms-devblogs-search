        This weekend, I attended a soccer match between  Chelsea FC  and   Celtic FC  at    Seahawks Stadium Qwest Field.  The game was the opener of the 2004    ChampionsWorld Series, wherein some of the top  soccer teams from Europe tour North America to give  us yanks a chance to see how football is done for real.
  From reading the team’s web sites before the match,  you’d think that Chelsea had already thrown in the towel,  because    even before the game started, they were making excuses,  blaming jet lag for their loss.  The excuses weren’t necessary, though, because    Chelsea dominated the match and ultimately won 4–2.
  It was interesting comparing the two teams’ styles.  When Chelsea scored a goal, you could watch it develop.  A through ball, a man open, a pass or two, and the ball is in  the back of the net.  Celtic’s goals were more of a  “And he’s got the ball, and… hey, how’d he score?”  It all happened so fast it was over before it began.
  Attendance was 30,000, only half the capacity of  Seahawks Stadium Qwest Field, but  a decent turnout I think for a sport that is still  considered fringe here in the States.
  Here’s Raymond’s checklist comparing the match to what  he figures a “proper” British football match to be like.

  One aspect of the British football divisions that I find  fascinating is    relegation, wherein the worst teams of the year are demoted  to the next lower league, replaced by the top teams of that  next lower league.  This doesn’t happen in U.S. sports leagues (at least not any of  the major ones).  In fact, in U.S. sports leagues,  the team that has the worst record is rewarded  with an early draft pick!  How’s that for reverse incentive.
