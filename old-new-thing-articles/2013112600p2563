        I stopped knitting a few years ago, but back when I knitted regularly, I tended to bring my knitting bag with me everywhere I went.
 There are a lot of idle minutes in your typical day. Waiting for the bus, waiting in line for the ATM, waiting for a meeting to start. There’s not enough time in those idle minutes to do anything substantial, but it’s enough time to sneak in a little bit of knitting.
 But there’s another reason I brought a knitting bag to every meeting.
 Nothing says “I don’t care about this meeting” like knitting.
