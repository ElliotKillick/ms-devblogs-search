          Wendy’s is getting rid of “Biggie” and “Great Biggie” size drinks and fries from their menu. Oh, they’re still offering them, just with a different name. What used to be “Biggie” is now “medium” and what used to be “Great Biggie” is now “large”. Even the “small” drink is a massive 20 ounces, or two and a half FDA servings.
