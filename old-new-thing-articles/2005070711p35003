         When people asked me for my reaction to the most recent Star Wars movie, I replied that what struck me most was that the Republic doesn’t appear to have any building codes. There are these platforms several hundred meters above the ground with no railings. For example, Padmé Amidala’s fancy apartment has a front porch far above the ground. Consider: You’re carrying a load of packages to the car, the kids are running around, you turn around to yell at one of them, miss a step, and over the rim you go. How many people fall to their deaths in that galaxy?
