        “Why would somebody ever want to do that?” you might ask. Well, this is a common appearance
        for floating toolbars. (But aside from that case, I can’t think of any other valid
        reason to draw a window as active even though it isn’t.)
    

        Fortunately this is easy to do. Just add this line to the WndProc of
        our scratch program:
    
    case WM_NCACTIVATE: if (wParam == FALSE) wParam = TRUE; break;


        This says, “If Windows asks me to paint my caption bar in the inactive state, turn
        around and draw it in the active state.”
