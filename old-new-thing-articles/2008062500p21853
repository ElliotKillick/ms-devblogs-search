         Here are the descriptions (verbatim) of two job positions open at a major video card manufacturer back in the late 1990’s: 

 Software Engineer – Drivers 
 The way in to a “hot” company in a “hot” field. This entry level position requires some programming experience with graphics preferred. 
 Senior Software Engineer – Applications (Demos) 
 This senior position requires considerable experience in 3D graphics or multimedia. Design, specification, and implementation of demos for new products will all be part of the mix.
