        A customer found that if they used the GUI and the icacls program to deny Delete permission to a folder, the results were different, even though the resulting ACLs are the same.
Create a user, say, Bob, and create a folder, say, C:\test.
With the GUI

Right-click the folder and select Properties.
Go the Security tab, click Advanced.
Click the Add button to add a new ACE.
Select Bob as the Principal.
Set the Type to Deny.
Click Show advanced permissions.
Check Delete and uncheck everything else.
Click OK a bunch of times to save the changes.

With icacls

From a command prompt, type icacls C:\test /deny Bob:D

If you followed the GUI steps, then Bob can open the directory in Explorer. On the other hand, if you followed the icacls steps, then Bob cannot open the directory in Explorer.
In both cases, running icacls to view the permissions report the same results:
C:\> icacls c:\test
test THISPC\Bob:(DENY)(D)
     BUILTIN\Administrators:(I)(OI)(CI)(F)
     NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(I)(OI)(CI)(F)
     BUILTIN\Users:(I)(OI)(CI)(RX)
     NT AUTHORITY\Authenticated Users:(I)(M)
     NT AUTHORITY\Authenticated Users:(I)(OI)(CI)(IO)(M)

How is it possible that the permissions are identical, yet the results are different depending on how you set the permissions?
The problem is that your tools are lying to you. The Deny ACE on the directory is not what icacls reports.
If you change the security with the GUI, then the Deny ACE is 0x00010000 = DELETE. But if you change it with the icacls program, then the Deny ACE is is 0x00110000 = DELETE | SYNCHRONIZE.
So the icacls program is lying when it says that it denied Delete (D) permission. It actually denied both Delete and Synchronize.
And then on top of that, the icacls program is lying when it says that the actual ACE is a Deny D. It’s hiding the denied SYNCHRONIZE access.
And it’s that denied SYNCHRONIZE access which is the difference. Explorer cannot open a folder where SYNCHRONIZE is denied. (And the command prompt cannot chdir into such a directory either.)
I’m guessing that the icacls is doing this extra work as a courtesy, but it also makes diagnosing problems more difficult.
