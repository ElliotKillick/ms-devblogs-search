         The local community newspaper featured a color photograph of a twelve-year-old student holding a bright orange safety flag while another student crosses the street in front of him. The caption reads as follows: 
 XYZ School 6th-grader John Doe, at right, will be honored Friday night at Safeco Field as one of the state’s top safety patrol students. 
 “On Monday morning, he will be found stuffed inside his locker,” the caption did not conclude.
