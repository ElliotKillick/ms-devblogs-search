        Sharktopus: Half-shark. Half-octopus. All-killer.
 I am not making that up.
 The Web site is  sharktopusmovie.com, presumably because  sharktopus.com was already taken. I am not making that up.
 I guess they wanted to ride the coattails of  Megashark vs. Giant Octopus?
 Even more disturbing discovery: Megashark vs. Giant Octopus has a sequel:  Megashark versus Crocosaurus.
 One of my colleagues says that heâ€™s going to wait for the sequel: Sharktopuses on a Plane.
