          I told you it was going to get weird. 
 In the month since my last report, there have been a few developments in the county council race between an accused drunk (the incumbent) and a fringe candidate (the challenger). 

     The incumbent admitted          having approved biographical information in which a bachelor’s degree     was claimed,     shortly after previously vehemently denying that any such     résumé inflation had taken place. 
     The incumbent     filed a campaign disclosure notice     revealing a $50,000 contribution to the campaign.     The challenger then filed a complaint on the grounds that     the contribution exceeded the legal limit.     The incumbent then claimed          that the notice was filed in error and no such contribution was made. 
     The challenger          will not have the support of the party he nominally belongs to. 
     The incumbent          agreed to pay a $8,000 fine     for campaign finance violations. 
     The incumbent’s pretrial hearing for drunk driving          has been delayed until after the election. 
     The incumbent’s party          tries to draw attention away from their candidate for a little while. 

  The Seattle Times tries to summarize the state of the race with a series of articles:

The story so far.
