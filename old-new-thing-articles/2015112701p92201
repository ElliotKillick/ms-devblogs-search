        Dynamic currency conversion is a service provided by merchants when processing credit cards payable in a foreign currency. Say, for example, you present a credit card issued by a United States bank to a hotel in Ireland, where the Euro is the local currency. In order to serve you better, the hotel will convert the fee from Euros into dollars. 
What they donâ€™t tell you is they will use a horrible exchange rate for the conversion.
