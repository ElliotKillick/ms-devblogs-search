        The International Chicken Sequencing Consortium announced  that it has completed the sequencing of chicken DNA.
 I repeat: There is an organization called “The International Chicken Sequencing Consortium”. 
 (For some reason I want to think these people get together and decide, “Okay, Ginger goes first, then Bunty, then Babs…”)
