Last time, we solved the problem with
the EndManualModalDialog function
by posting a harmless message.
Today, we’re going to solve the problem in an entirely
different way.


The idea here is to make sure the modal message loop
regains control, even if all that happened were incoming
sent messages, so that it can detect that the fEnded
flag is set and break out of the modal loop.


Instead of changing
the EndManualModalDialog function,
we will change the modal message loop.


int DoModal(HWND hwnd)
{
 DIALOGSTATE ds = { 0 };
 HWND hdlg = CreateDialogParam(g_hinst, MAKEINTRESOURCE(1),
             hwnd, DlgProc, reinterpret_cast<LPARAM>(&ds));
 if (!hdlg) {
  return -1;
 }
 EnableWindow(hwnd, FALSE);
 MSG msg;
 msg.message = WM_NULL; // anything that isn't WM_QUIT
 while (!ds.fEnded) {
  if (PeekMessage(&msg, NULL, 0, 0, PM_REMOVE)) {
   if (msg.message == WM_QUIT) { /*  fixed 8am */
    break;
   } else if (!IsDialogMessage(hdlg, &msg)) {
    TranslateMessage(&msg);
    DispatchMessage(&msg);
   } /* fixed 10am */
  } else if (!ds.fEnded) {
   WaitMessage();
  }
 }
 if (msg.message == WM_QUIT) {
  PostQuitMessage((int)msg.wParam);
 }
 EnableWindow(hwnd, TRUE);
 DestroyWindow(hdlg);
 return ds.iResult;
}


We changed the call to GetMessage
into a call to

the PeekMessage function,
asking to remove the peeked message if any.
Like GetMessage,
this delivers any incoming sent messages,
then checks if there are any posted messages in the queue.
The difference is that whereas GetMessage
keeps waiting if there are no posted message,
PeekMessage returns and tells you that there
were no posted messages.


That’s the control we want.
If PeekMessage says that it couldn’t
find a posted message, we check our fEnded
flag once again, in case an incoming sent message
set the fEnded flag.
If not, then we call

the WaitMessage function
to wait until there is something to do
(either an incoming sent message or a posted message).


Exercise: If the whole point was to regain control
after sent messages are delivered, why isn’t there a test
of the fEnded flag immediately after
DispatchMessage returns?
