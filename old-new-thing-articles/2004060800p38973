        Kenny Mayne is one of the regular anchors for  ESPN SportsCenter  and for some reason I find this particular home run call hilarious:
  I am king of the diamond!    Let there be a grand clubhouse feast! [WAV]  Bring me the finest meats and cheeses throughout the land!    — From The  SportsCenter Altar multimedia download center.  
  Here’s    a whimisical interview where he explains where he got that from  [RealAudio].
  Another one I like for its understatedness:
    <Football player> has decided to tackle people on behalf of  the <NFL team>.  Terms of the contract are not disclosed,  but we believe it has something to do with money.  
  Actually, I enjoyed just reading through    a collection of phrases used by the SportsCenter anchors.
  Almost makes me want to watch television.
