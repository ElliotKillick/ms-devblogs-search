When you enter Terminal 6 and turn right to enter
the security queue,
there are two sets of security equipment.
If you are directed to the far set of equipment,
you will find three lines for screening.
At the point at which you have to choose which line to take,
you can’t see how your decision is going to play out.
The arrangement is

effectively the same as at Newark:
You want to take the rightmost line,
number three in the diagram below.
