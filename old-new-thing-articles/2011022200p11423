         A fellow Microsoft employee volunteered a story from his prior work at a hospital as their enterprise architect. 

 I received an escalation from our Tier 1 service desk on a  Dr. Watson. Why would I get a simple escalation? Strange… 
 Since I hadn’t seen the outside of my cubicle for a while, I decided to walk over to talk to the customer in person. 
 The employee having the problem was named Dr. Watson. His computer had bluescreened. 
 I still get a chuckle out of that years later. That little unexpected name collision threw twelve people in the IT service and support teams into disarray.
