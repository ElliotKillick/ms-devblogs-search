        A customer wanted to know which of the git tricks I’ve shared still work if you use a squash instead of a true merge. For example, in the case of  splitting a file in two while preserving line history, can this be done with squashing?
Many of the git tricks exploit the way git walks the commit graph, and squashing creates a different graph from merging. Specifically, squashing throws away all our hard work in building a specific commit graph. Instead, squashing takes all the changes and squashes them together into a single commit. It’s as if you made all the changes at one sitting and committed them as a unit.
On the other hand, squashing works just fine with the tricks that involve a single non-merge commit. It just replaces one non-merge commit with an identical one.



Trick
Squashable?
Notes


 Merging instead of cherry-picking
No
Merging is the point


 Building a commit manually out of a tree
Yes
Creates a single non-merge commit


 Building a merge commit manually out of a tree
No
Result is a merge commit


 Building a throwaway commit in order to perform a combined cherry-pick-squash
Yes
Creates a single non-merge commit


 Changing a squash to a merge
No
Result is a merge commit (that’s the whole point)


 Squashing without git rebase
Yes
Creates a single non-merge commit


 Resetting by reusing an earlier tree
No
Result is a commit that needs to be merged


 Combining two files into one while preserving line history
No
Creates merge commits


 Combining two files into one while preserving line history, via manual octopus merging
No
Creates merge commits


 How do I split a file into two while preserving git line history?
No
Creates merge commits


 How to split out pieces of a file while preserving git line history v1
No
Creates merge commits


 How to split out pieces of a file while preserving git line history v2
No
Creates merge commits


 How to duplicate a file while preserving git line history
No
Creates merge commits


 Converting a rebase to a merge
No
Creates merge commits


 How can I bulk-revert an entire repo to an earlier commit?
It depends
Method 1 uses a single non-merge commit, but method 2 uses a merge


 How can I bulk-revert a subdirectory of a repo to an earlier commit?
Yes
Creates a single non-merge commit
