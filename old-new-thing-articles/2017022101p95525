        We had extended family over for a visit, and we decided to take everybody to the public swimming pool. While waiting in line, the kids (ages 4 through 7) somehow got onto the topic of lifeguards. 
Six-year-old: “I hate lifeguards. Whenever you do something fun, they tell you to stop.” 
Four-year-old: “I hate lifeguards, too. They made me stop hopping. But I didn’t fall down! When I grow up, I want to be a lifeguard, so I can yell at people.”
