        In an internal discussion of the women blogger conference known as BlogHer, somebody asked, “Why isn’t there a BlogHim?” I replied,
 Isn’t that the plural of the word “blog” in Hebrew? 
 This got quite an amused response from the Hebrew-speaking (or at least vaguely Hebrew-aware) members of the mailing list.
 Not bad for having studied Hebrew for about ten seconds. (Apparently a better spelling of the plural would be “blogim” or “bloggim”. But it wouldn’t have been as funny.)
