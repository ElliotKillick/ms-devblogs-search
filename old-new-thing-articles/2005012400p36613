The CMD.EXE batch language

can be awfully cryptic,
but for those who miss the richness of command lines like


kill -1 $(ps -ef | grep inetd | grep -v grep | tr -s " " | cut -f2 -d " ")

or bursts of line noise masquerading as a pipeline of
“find”, “sed”, and “awk” processes,

Microsoft Windows Services for Unix is available for

free download.
