        Control panel programs and property sheets don’t show up in the taskbar. Why not?
 As I recall, the explanation was that control panel programs and property sheets aren’t applications.  They are auxiliary helper windows that assist you with a task, but they aren’t a program in their own right. Therefore, they don’t get a taskbar button.
 I’ve always been kind of suspicious of that explanation, but there it is, make of it what you will. (I don’t mind the behavior—putting them in the taskbar just creates clutter—but the explanation I found kind of wanting.)
