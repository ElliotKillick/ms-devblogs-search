         Mark your calendars: Fabio Lanzoni, better known to the world as simply Fabio, will be  at the Redmond Whole Foods Market on June 21 to promote  his whey protein product. (Now made with real Fabio!) And unlike  Martha, he will let you take a picture of him. 
 By the way, ladies,  heâ€™s available!
