        My colleague  Doron Holan has started writing about kernel mode driver programming, and it looks like he’s jumping in with both feet. I have to admit that I don’t understand what he’s saying (not being a kernel-mode person myself), but I can assure you that he knows what he’s talking about.
 (Note that he’s writing about driver programming, so if you’re just looking for an XYZ driver, he won’t be able to help you. On the other hand, if you are writing the XYZ driver, then the information he has may prove useful after all.)
 Even though I’ve known Doron for several years, I think we’ve met face-to-face a total of four times. That’s what happens when your interactions with someone take place nearly entirely over email. And there’s a good chance that when I do meet him in person, I’ll pronounce his name wrong. (He seems to be okay with it, though. Or he hides it well.)
