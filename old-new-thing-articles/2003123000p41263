          Even though Danish is impossible for me to pronounce, I do  appreciate their stubborn resistance to decimalization.  The number 71 is (I hope I get this right) “en og halvfjerdsindstyve”,  literally, “one and half-four-times-twenty”, or  more commonly, just “en og halvfjerds”.  (Those familiar with other Germanic languages recognize “half-four”  as meaning “three and a half”.)  
  (I hope the Danes out there realize that my previous remarks about Danish  were all in fun.  I’m just fascinated with languages, especially those  in the Germanic branch.)
