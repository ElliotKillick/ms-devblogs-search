          The site  www.emr.fr  has been “under construction” for over eight years.  I noticed it in June 1996 and check back on it periodically.  Still Under Construction.  
  Another site that I noticed as “Under Construction”  in June 1996 is  www.leary.com.  And as of this writing, it is still  under construction.
