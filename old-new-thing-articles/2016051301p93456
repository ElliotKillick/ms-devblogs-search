        Two fires in one day in the Washington, DC Metro inspired a single-serving-site: ismetroonfiretoday.com. 
Answers the question on the tin. 
Bonus chatter: One of my friends told me that a few jobs ago, the project he worked on had a problem with people checking changes into the project when the tree was supposed to be locked. And by “people”, he meant “pretty much just one guy in particular”. At a team meeting convened to discuss the problem, he somewhat sarcastically asked, “What do you want? A Web site called isthecontosotreelocked.com?” 
The other developer said, “Hey, that’s a great idea.” 
So my friend pulled out his credit card and bought the domain isthecontosotreelocked.com, and uploaded a one-word page: “No.” 
Update: There’s another site ismetroonfire.com that claims to derive its fire/no-fire information by monitoring Twitter.
