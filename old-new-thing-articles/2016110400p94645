        A customer was studying a minidump collected by Windows Error Reporting. The minidump includes the contents of the stack, but the contents are randomly filled with 0xAAAAAAAA.

What’s going on here? 
What’s going on is that the minidump has been filtered. The customer missed this message from the debugger that was printed at the top of the debug session: 

User Mini Triage Dump File: Only registers, stack and portions of memory are available 
The user dump currently examined is a triage dump. Consequently, only a subset of debugger functionality will be available. If needed, please collect a minidump or a heap dump. 

To create a mini user dump use the command: .dump /m <filename>
To create a full user dump use the command: .dump /ma <filename>

Triage dumps have certain values on the stack and in the register contexts overwritten with pattern 0xAAAAAAAA. If you see this value 

the original value was not NULL 
the original value was not a direct pointer to a loaded or unloaded image 
the original value did not point to an object whose VFT points to a loaded or          unloaded image (indirect pointer) 
the original value did not point to the stack itself or any memory area added to          the dump (TEB, PEB, memory for CLR stackwalk or exceptions, etc.) 
the original value was not a valid handle value 
After receiving this explanation, the customer was still a bit dubious. “A lot of function parameters in the dump are being given as 0xAAAAAAAA, which suggests that they have been filtered out. But I thought constant strings and plain integers should still be on the stack. Does the fact that I don’t see them mean that they were corrupted?” 
If you look at the information banner printed by the debugger, you can see that plain integers are not on the list of things exempt from filtering. You might still see an integer if it happens to match a value that is exempt from filtering, such as if it happens to be zero or match a valid handle. 
As for constant strings, it depends on how the constant string is stored. If it’s a literal string embedded in a module, then it would be exempt from filtering according to rule 2. But if the string were copied to the heap or to the stack, then that would make it subject to filtering.
