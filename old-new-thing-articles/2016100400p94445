        I’ve written about my colleague Danny some time ago. Danny is an accomplished skier, and for a time, he had a poster in his office that was a split-screen of Picabo Street and Alberto Tomba, and autographed by both skiers. 
I remarked, “Wow, that’s amazing. You got Picabo Street and Alberto Tomba to autograph the same poster!” 
Danny copped to the truth. 
“Well, sort of. That autograph of Picabo Street is authentic. After she signed her name on her half of the poster, I asked her to forge Alberto Tomba’s signature on the other half.”
