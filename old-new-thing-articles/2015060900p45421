        One of my colleagues told me that my name came up in conversation, and somebody said that they thought I had a reputation for being bitter. 
My colleague defended me. “Nah, Raymond isn’t bitter. He’s, I dunno, acerbic.” 
“Acerbic? What does that mean?” 
My colleague looked it up. 
“It means, um… bitter.”
