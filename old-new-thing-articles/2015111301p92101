        There’s still time to get to the Hello Kitty Supercute Opening Party at the Experience Music Project, kicking off a four-month exhibition of Everything Hello Kitty. (Here are pictures from the Los Angeles leg of the tour.) 
Curiously, one of the events on the agenda for the opening night gala is a “Q&A with Hello Kitty” at 8:00pm, which is going to be interesting, seeing as Hello Kitty does not have a mouth. 
One of the exhibit’s sponsors is UNIQLO, who I should remind you, has a very strange clock. 
Bonus chatter: EVA Air now has a thrice-weekly flight between Taipei and Houston, so you can now fly Hello Kitty Air from the United States.
