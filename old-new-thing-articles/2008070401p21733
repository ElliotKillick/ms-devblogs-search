         Firefighters hate the Fourth of July, the holiday dedicated to  blowing up stuff, because when amateurs try to blow up stuff, they often blow up stuff they didnâ€™t intend to blow up. One of my friends has a particular unfortunate knack of drawing disasters to his neighborhood. One July 4th, a house in his neighborhood burnt down due to a stray firecracker landing on a wooden roof. A few years later, he moved to another neighborhood, and the next July 4th,  a house in his neighborhood burnt down due to a stray firecracker landing on a wooden roof. 
 The Seattle Fire Department lets you  view all the incidents to which they responded, and the year I checked (the year of the second house-burning-down), the Seattle Fire Department responded to twice as many reports on the fourth as they did on the third.
