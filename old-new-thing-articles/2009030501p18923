         The winner completes the race in just ten minutes and seven seconds, but the vertical climb is a killer: Straight up the 1576 steps of the  Empire State Building to the Observation deck. (When I visit the Observation Deck of the Empire State Building, I use the elevator.) 
 And when it’s over, everybody goes to work. 
 What else am I going to do, like go celebrate? Am I going to go have martinis at 11:30 in the morning? No, you  slink into work and you sit at your desk, and you work all day, and when you’re done you stand up and your back is stiff, and you call your wife, and you get yelled at, and you go home to your three kids. Just like another day.
