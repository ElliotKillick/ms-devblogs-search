         Not satisfied with a patio or treehouse, some people have built  a monorail or a  roller coaster in their backyard. And then thereâ€™s this one guy  who apparently has not yet run out of strange things to build in his backyard. Former projects include include a domed swimming pool, a garden accessible only from above, a carousel, and a forty-four foot kite.
