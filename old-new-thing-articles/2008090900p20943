         Despite my  previous rant, absurdly elaborate email signatures are still common at Microsoft, and I’m not just talking about the ones that contain information that may be required by department policy. I’m talking about signatures that use bright colors, large fonts, maybe a bitmap or two, sometimes even a photo of the sender! I will sometimes mention in my reply, “Please consider making your signature less eye-catching. It distracts from the text of your message.” But other times, I just incorporate it in to the reply more directly: 
 From: John Doe 
 Blah blah blah question blah blah blah.

 My reply might go like this: 
 To: John Doe 
 Hi, John Doe. 
 Blah blah blah answer blah blah blah.
