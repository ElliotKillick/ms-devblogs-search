        I was riding in a car with a friend when  a Chinese pop album spun up on the CD. I made a remark about the song, and my friend, knowing that I was studying Mandarin, asked me, “Do you know what she’s singing about?”
 I immediately replied, “She’s singing about love.”
 “Wow,” my friend responded. “Your Chinese is quite good.”
 “Nope,” I said. “But all pop songs are about love.”
 If somebody asks you what a pop song is about, you can answer “love”, and you’ve got a very high chance of being correct.
