         Some commenters mentioned that I should write a book. It turns out that writing a book is hard.
 A few years ago, MS Press actually approached me about writing a book for them. But I declined because the fashion for technical books is to take maybe fifty pages of information and pad it to a 700-page book, and I can’t write that way. None of my topics would ever make it to a 100-page chapter. They’re just little page-and-a-half vignettes. And it’s not like the world needs yet another book on Win32 programming.
 So I’ll just continue to babble here. It’s easier.
