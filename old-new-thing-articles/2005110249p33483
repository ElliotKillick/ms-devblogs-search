         On one of our internal blogging aliases, some people were interested in ways of making their blog look spiffier, and the  Max team’s blog was pointed out as an example of a “pimped out blog”. This in turn led to exchange of  tips and  tricks and someone even proposed an informal   Pimp My Blog contest. What next?  Extreme Blog Makeover?  Trading MSN Spaces?
