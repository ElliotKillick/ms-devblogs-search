        A colleague of mine submitted some paperwork regarding the end-date of his  college intern. The automated response combined HR buzzwords in an unfortunate way:
 Subject: Intern Termination Report was executed 
 Just to be sure, my colleague stopped by his intern’s office. He’s still there. And still alive.
 For now.
