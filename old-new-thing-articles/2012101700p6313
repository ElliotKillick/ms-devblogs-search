        On an internal mailing list, somebody asked a question about how to do X with Y, and I replied with a link to an internal wiki that described how to do X with Y (answer: use the Z tool).
 Somebody else replied, “Time to update that article because the link to the Z tool is broken.”
 Apparently, this person forgot that one of the defining characteristics of a wiki is that it’s easy to edit. (Another characteristic is that it is collaboratively-edited; there is no central authority.)
 In other words, if you see something wrong, fix it yourself. Don’t just stand around saying somebody should do something.  Be someone. Because on a wiki, there is no default value for somebody.
