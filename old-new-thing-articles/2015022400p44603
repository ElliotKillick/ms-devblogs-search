        Bill Gates does not praise lightly. 
Some time ago, a colleague of mine helped to prepared a keynote address for Bill Gates. Afterward, he was informed that Bill rated the presentation an “A minus“. 
My colleague thought, “Wow, an A minus. It would be great to get some feedback from Bill about where I could have done better.” 
Bill’s assistant explained, “Don’t worry. That’s the highest grade he gives.”
