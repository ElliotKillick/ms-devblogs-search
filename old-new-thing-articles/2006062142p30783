         I’m glad I’m not the only person to notice that  elections for boards of directors are completely rigged so that the nominees always win and there’s nothing you can do about it. It appears that the issue was  the hot topic in this year’s proxy war skirmishes. 
 This year, one company actually called me at home asking me to send in my proxy. I guess they didn’t have enough votes for the meeting to be held. I explained that not voting was an intentional decision on my part, since it was the only way I could prevent the board of directors from being elected. The caller appeared mollified by that explanation and didn’t press the issue further.
