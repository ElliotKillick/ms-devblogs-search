         If you look at the implementation of FlushInstructionCache on Windows 95, you’ll see that it’s just a return instruction. It doesn’t actually do anything. So why do you have to call it? 
 Because the act of calling it is the whole point. The control transfers implicit in calling a function suffice to flush the instruction cache on a Pentium. The function doesn’t have to do anything else; it is fact that you called a function that is important.
