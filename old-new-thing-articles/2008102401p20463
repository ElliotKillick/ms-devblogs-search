        Consider  this house on Mercer Island, which happens to be  for sale. Asking price: A shade under $35 million. Five bedrooms, nine bathrooms, over  22 thousand square feet, two swimming pools, space to park a 140-foot yacht, and an interior so opulent you’d be afraid to touch anything. If you were even allowed anywhere near it.
 But the sagging economy has taken its toll on this house.  They were originally asking $40 million. 
 Best line from the article: 
 “But we decided we might want to simplify a little, and move to Medina.”  
 For those who aren’t familiar with Seattle-area geography, Medina is the quiet little town which has the modest homes of simple people  like Bill Gates.
