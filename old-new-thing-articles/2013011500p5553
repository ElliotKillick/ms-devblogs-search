        A few projects ago, I worked on a team whose members came to work by a wide variety of modes. If there were some sort of award for alternative commuting, we would’ve been eligible.

Two bicyclists. 
One runner. 
One motorcyclist. 
Two full-time telecommuters. 
One part-time telecommuter. 
One traditional car commuter. (Freak.) 

 One of the full-time telecommuters was based in Spain, which was handy because he was available to deal with issues that cropped up while everybody in Redmond was sleeping. 
 Perhaps to compensate for all the gasoline being saved by his employees, our manager drove an oversized pick-up truck to work.
