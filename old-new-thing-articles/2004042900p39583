        Sometimes you’ll start typing a complex command line and  then realize that you can’t execute it now.  Perhaps you’re in the wrong directory  or you forgot to map the drive.  It would be a shame to hit ESC and lose that command line.
  What I do is edit the line to insert the word “echo” in front,  then hit Enter.  (Note: This doesn’t work if you have command  line redirection.)
  This prints the command to the screen, where it can be cut/pasted  later.  Even more, it enters the line into the   command history, so a few uparrows will bring it back.
