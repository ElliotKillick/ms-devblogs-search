         The movie  This Is Spinal Tap introduced the world to the phrase going to eleven. The people over at Windows Media Player were not immune to its charms,  alluding to the catchphrase in their advertising campaign. 
 Back in WindowsÂ 95, I know that there was at least one person who lobbied the multimedia team to give the Volume Control program eleven notches in its control slider as a tribute. Alas, their efforts were ultimately unsuccessful, but it was cute to know that somebody considered the possibility.
