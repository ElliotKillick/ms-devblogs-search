         I noted some time ago that  I have taken to “blaming” Exchange when someone assumes that my reply to a thread on a distribution list implies that I have taken responsibility for resolving their problem. One of my colleagues in another group is in a similar situation with respect to a different product, and he has taken to using the same basic formulation when sending issues back to the distribution list. 
 One variation he used a while back gave me a chuckle: 
 We need a new Exchange server.  This one keeps stripping the mailing list.
