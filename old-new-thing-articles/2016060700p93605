        It used to be that if you needed to create a recording of a program on the PC, you had to get Expressions Encoder or some other capture program. But the feature is now built into Windows 10, assuming you’re willing to do some pretending. 
Windows 10 brings the Xbox Game DVR feature to the PC. The Game DVR feature lets you record yourself playing a video game, so you can share the recording with your friends. 
Suppose you have some program that you want to record, say for a bug report or for an instructional video. Just pretend it’s a game: 

Put focus on the program you want to record. 
Press Win+G to open the Game Bar.     If it asks whether you want to open the Game Bar,     say, “Yes, this is a game.” 
Press the red circle to start recording,     or press Win+Alt+R. 
Do the thing you want to record. 
Open the Game Bar     and press the red square to stop recording.     Or use the hotkey Win+Alt+R. 
Optional: Open the Game Bar,     click the gear icon, and uncheck “Remember this app as a game.” 
The recording is placed in your Videos\Captures folder. 
You can configure the capture settings from the Xbox app.
