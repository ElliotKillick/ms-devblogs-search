         Okay, that’s basically the end of the scrollbar series.
 Do people actually like the idea of a coding series? It gets very few comments, and it’s a lot of work to write, so if nobody actually cares I can just write about quick little things and not try to be coherent from day to day.
 I guess that’s what most blogs are like anyway.
If you like the idea of a coding series, what other topics would you like covered?
