        Some suggestion box topics turn into daily entries. Others deserve just a sentence or two. Here are the short answers.

          Can you shed some light on RPC_E_CANTCALLOUT_ININPUTSYNCCALL? 
This one is kind of bizarre, because the person who asked the question          linked to the answer! 
          What form do application hacks usually take in Windows? 
     They take many forms, depending on the situation,     but checking a window caption is definitely ill-advised,     since that creates the opportunity both for false positives     (what if an unrelated program happens to have the same caption?)     and false negatives (will the German version of the program have     the same caption?).     On a related note,          Chris Jackson     writes about     the shim proces itself,     which you might find interesting. 

          Why doesn’t PathFileExists support UNCs? 

Actually, it does.     What the documentation is trying to say is that     it doesn’t work is for things like \\server.     That will return FALSE even if the server exists.     (I’ve sent a clarification to the documentation team.     Who knows whether they’ll accept it.) 

          A series of remarks (but no question) about Kennedy-Western University 

This wasn’t a topic suggestion, just somebody who wanted to     take what I said and argue against it with made-up facts.     “I to enjoy people that display their ignorance in frount of all of us.”     You can get a mirror at Ikea for just a few dollars. 

          How do I put focus on a window without raising it? 

One of the window manager’s design principles is that the active     window comes to the top. 

          Some really long list of complaints 

Um, I didn’t see a topic suggestion in there.     (Not that I really had much incentive to look hard for one.)     It looks like just a bunch of ranting. 

          On tooltips that get stuck behind other windows     (Question was          duplicated.     How hard is it to search the Suggestion Box page to see if somebody     already asked your question?) 

If you set your owner correctly and don’t play weird games,     everything will be just fine.     The problem is that the taskbar has to play weird games     because of all the other applications that play even weirder     games.     When you play weird games, things get weird. 

Is there a way to send input other than SendInput? 

No.          You can try to fake it but you’re going to run into problems. 

          Why doesn’t AltGr+Del act like Ctrl+Alt+Del? 

I don’t know but I can guess, and so can you.     Hint: Component layering.     Low-level components vs. higher-level components. 

          Why do some MSDN samples use the goto statement? 

That’s a coding style issue.     Believe it or not, different people have different styles,     and there is no mandated “MSDN coding style”.          Some people are more averse to the goto statement than others. 

A question putatively about WS_TABSTOP 

Somthing is horribly wrong with your program design if each     edit control in your dialog has its own message pump!     Fix that first, then the tab stop issue should fix itself. 

Why can’t you call SetFocus() on a window in another     thread? 

I covered this in          my PDC 2005 talk. 


 Another category is people who ask a question I’ve already answered or ask a question that has already been asked.

Why doesn’t the taskbar have my pet feature?          Again.          And again.          And again.     Is it so hard to search on the very page you’re posting your     suggestion to? 
I already discussed          the feature process.     I happen to know the person responsible for Start menu and taskbar     features in Windows Vista.     The list of design changes and feature requests     was over 200 items long and obviously not all of them     could be addressed.     (And that list was just of the design changes and feature requests     that overcame the starting point of          minus 100 points.) 

What are these mystery folders in my Program Files directory? 

Answer. 

What is the deal with the time zone map? 

This question was asked          over two years after I answered it.     What’s particularly baffling about this one is that the time zone     article is one of the most frequently-linked entries I’ve written!     How could the person not have found it? 

Is there way to get the current full path from an Explorer window? 

I answered this          over a year previously     and then again          three months before the suggestion was posted. 

     Why do some files come up strange in Notepad? 

I answered this          over two years previously. 

     Why does the resource compiler complain about strings longer than     255 characters? 

I answered this          over two years previously. 


 And then there are the people who ask questions on things that I explicitly listed as topics I am not inclined to cover.

Comments on the blog software itself.     (Like          this one about how the categories are browsed.     Or          this one saying that search doesn’t work.     Or          this one complaining about the layout of the navigation area.     The blog software determines the layout of the navigation area.          Somebody else is having trouble subscribing via email.     Remember, I don’t control this stuff.) 
Internet Explorer.     (Such as          this one about Internet Explorer context menu extensions     and          this one about the Microsoft Virtual Machine.) 
Visual Studio.     (Such as          this one complaining that a project built with Visual Studio 2003     behaves differently from one built with Visual Studio 6.     Or          this one asking a question about the C runtime     stat function.) 
Non-software Microsoft topics, such as product support policies,     marketing tactics, jobs and careers, legal issues.     (Such as          this one asking for career advice     or          this one asking about the same thing but much more verbosely.) 
Microsoft software that isn’t Windows.     (Such as          this one that asks about a bug in Access 97.     Or          this one that appears to be rant about Small Business Accounting.          This one asks about the Outlook New Mail sound.          This one complains about Windows Installer.          This one complains about MSDN search.) 
Windows topics outside user interface programming.     (Such as          this one about power management,     which would be better-posed to the power mangement folks on the          Tablet PC blog and the          Mobile PC blog,     though from what I can tell, the feature you’re asking for is     already in Vista since it was the power management team’s #1 issue!          Here’s another misdirected power management question.          This person wants me to discuss OpenGL 2.0.          This person wants me to discuss the network redirector.          This person wants details on BeginUpdateResource     and the PE loader.) 
User interface programming in anything other than Win32.     (Such as          this one about some application framework that is probably MFC     although the person didn’t say so explicitly.     Here’s          another one that is probably using MFC though they didn’t say so     explicitly.) 
Debugging a specific problem.     (Such as          this one asking me to debug something on a forum I don’t have     access to anyway.     Or          this one from somebody having trouble with pattern brushes in     some scripting language I’ve never heard of much less have any     degree of expertise in.) 
Predictions for the future.     (Such as          this one that asks me what I think about two acronyms I’ve     never heard of.     Or          this one that asks me to predict the future of dual core machines.) 

 And then there are the suggestions that are so wildly off topic I don’t even know why they bothered to ask me, such as  this person who wants me to discuss a VB6 language feature and another  who wants me to discuss non-short-circuit evaluation in Visual Basic. I have no idea why they chose me to ask these questions.  In my experience, VB doesn’t even stand for Visual Basic! Another person asked  a long, rambling question about Unicode IME that I got tired of reading.
 I’m kind of baffled by  this comment asking how to post a comment.
 Other topics I am unlikely to cover are  personal biography since that just leads to WikiStalking.
 Don’t ask  the same question to  multiple people.  It duplicates effort. (Another  example.)
  And  then  there  are  people  who  just  like  to  natter  on  about  their  uneventful  lives,  yammering  repetitively  about  how  nothing  is  going  on  and  that  they  are  bored.  Hey,  don’t  take  your  boredom  out  on  me.  I’m  trying  to  get  some  work  done  here.  If  you  want  to  chatter,  go  start  your  own  blog.

 The ideal length for a topic suggestion is a single paragraph between two to four sentences. If it’s too short, there isn’t enough context. If it’s too long, I will lose interest and not bother reading the suggestion.
 That’s all the short answers for this year. (You may have noticed that I’ve generally been using Mondays to following up on topics posted to the suggestion box or in blog comments.)
