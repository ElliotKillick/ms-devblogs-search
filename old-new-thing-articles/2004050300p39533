        Of course, in Sweden, every day is tax day.
  By now, itâ€™s too late to fill out your tax form,  which    the Swedish tax agency permits you to file  on paper, via Internet, over the phone, or even via SMS.
  They even have what I wish  the US tax agency had:    An online tax form calculator.
