         It’s soon going to come to the point where this is no longer news.  The Seattle monorail broke down again, just six days since  the previous breakdown, which was in turn just two days after  operations resumed. 
 I think they need to put up a big sign at the Monorail station at Seattle Center that reads 

  6 days since last breakdown.  

 Well, except that today it would read “2”.
