        When you right-click on an empty space in an Explorer folder and select the New menu item, you always start with Folder and Shortcut, but the rest seems to be a jumbled list of file types.

The list looks jumbled, but it’s a very specific kind of jumbled.
The items in the New menu are discovered by  looking for Shell­New subkeys in HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT. And a side effect of the way Explorer walks through the registry and collects the results is that they end up sorted alphabetically by file extension.

This behavior is not contractual. It’s just an artifact of the implementation. Maybe it’ll change someday.
