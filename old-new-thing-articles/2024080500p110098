        The  documentation on the Run and RunOnce keys contains this caution:
An application must not continually recreate entries under RunOnce because this will interfere with Windows Setup.
What is this “interfere with Windows Setup” all about?
There’s a clue earlier in that same paragraph:
Applications should use the RunOnce key only for transient conditions, such as to complete application setup.
The intended purpose of the RunOnce is to allow application installers to do some work after a restart to complete the installation. Therefore, any pending RunOnce entries suggest that an application install is still in progress, and Windows Setup tries not to upgrade a system while an application is in the middle of installing. (After all, who writes an installer that handles the case where the operating system is upgraded mid-install?)
Windows Setup is used not just for installing Windows from scratch, but also for upgrading from one version of Windows to another. And any persistent RunOnce entry will cause Windows Setup to keep asking, “My goodness, can this application finish installing so I can finally start upgrading the OS?”
