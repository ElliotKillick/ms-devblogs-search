         Okay, so it’s bad enough that  I write like a girl. (And  so does Betsy.) Now, Korby Parnell reported on  a little get-together of some Microsoft bloggers, and in the photograph you can see that I’m doing the “peace” sign, just like young Japanese women do in photographs. Apparently, boys are supposed to strike a superhero pose, but the peace sign is so much more fun.
