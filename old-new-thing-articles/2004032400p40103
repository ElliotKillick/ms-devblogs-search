        McDonalds anonunced that    it would no longer offer “Super Size” on its menu.  The ostensible reason was that the addition of newer healthier  options didn’t leave room on the menu for “Super Size”.
  This was of course laughable on its face.
  Now it’s even more laughable,  because it turns out that    the so-called “healthy” options are even fattier than the burgers.  You can see for yourself on McDonalds’ own    Interactive Nutrition Counter.  A Caesar Salad with Chicken Premiere contains 18.4 grams of fat,  compared to 11.5 grams of fat in a cheeseburger.
