        I get called on frequently to do troubleshooting, so I figure I’d share some entries
        from my private bag of tricks.  (And there are some remarks for programmers hidden
        here too.)
    

        Problem 1. A folder like C:\Program Files\LitWare opens each time you
        log on.
    


        Reason: Your system contains two sibling directories where one is a strict
        prefix of the second. For example,
    
C:\Program Files\LitWare
C:\Program Files\LitWare Deluxe


        If you go to regedit, you will likely find under
    
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run


        or
    
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run


        an entry that refers to a program in the longer directory, like
    
Reminder=REG_SZ:C:\Program Files\LitWare Deluxe\reminder.exe


        What’s more, the reference such as the one above will not have quotation marks to
        protect the embedded spaces in the name.
    

        What’s going on is that LitWare Deluxe wants to run C:\Program Files\LitWare
        Deluxe\reminder.exe, but due to the spaces, this first gets parsed as
    
app = C:\Program
command line=Files\LitWare Deluxe\reminder.exe 

        This fails, so the system tries again with
    
app = C:\Program Files\LitWare
command line=Deluxe\reminder.exe 

        and this succeeds because you have a folder called C:\Program Files\LitWare.
        Edit the string and add the quotation marks.
    

        Note to programmers: This is why it’s important to quote your filenames if they contain
        spaces.
    


        Problem 2. A desktop.ini file opens when you log on.
    


        Reason: The System and Hidden attributes for the file desktop.ini in
        the directory
    
C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Start Menu\Startup

        or
    
C:\Documents and Settings\yourname\Start Menu\Startup

        have been lost. Alternatively, you went to the advanced Folder Options and disabled
        “Hide protected operating system files (Recommended)”.
    

        If a file is marked with both the System and Hidden attributes, Explorer will not
        enumerate it, thereby hiding it from the user. If you disable “Hide protected operating
        system files”, then this rule is suppressed.
    

        When you log on, one of the things that Explorer does is enumerate the contents of
        your Startup folders and runs each file it finds. If the desktop.ini is not marked
        System+Hidden (or you disabled the rule that filters them out), then it will be opened.
    

        What is this file for?
    

        This file is used to support Windows XP’s Multilingual
        User Interface, which allows you to change the language you use to interact with
        Windows, so for example you could say, “I want everything to be in French” and Windows
        will translate all its menus, shortcuts, dialog boxes, etc. into French. Specifically,
        this file instructs Windows how to translate the word “Startup” into French, German,
        Spanish, etc. 
    

        Programmatically, you use the SHSetLocalizedName function
        to set the multilingual name for a file or folder.
