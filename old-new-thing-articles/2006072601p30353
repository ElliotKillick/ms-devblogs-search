         Hot off the presses. Real Madrid (with David Beckham, Ronaldo, and other stars)  will play an exhibition match against D. C. United in Seah^H^H^H^HQuest Field on Wednesday, August 9th. I wonder if it’ll be anything like  the last soccer match I saw. At least let’s hope they’re ready to play instead of  having tired themselves out playing video games.
