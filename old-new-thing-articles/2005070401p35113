        Today is a holiday in the United States, so I thought I’d go entirely non-technical. But that doesn’t mean you get to rest your brain.
 One of my friends was accepted to  the Graduate School of Library and Information Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. We are of course very happy for her, but also sad that she will be leaving us. As part of her going-away festivities, we sent her on a one-team  Puzzle Hunt because she’s a puzzle fan and regretted missing out on the most recent Hunt. Our puzzles took her to various landmarks in the Seattle area, culminating at the location of the big party. At each landmark, a different group of her friends was be there to greet her, socialize, and give her the next puzzle. 
 There were six puzzles in all. I have made some adjustments to the puzzles to remove the “inside jokes”; otherwise you wouldn’t stand a chance! Knowledge of Seattle is still important, though. 
 No reference materials allowed.  All you have is a pencil and your brain. 
 The first puzzle is a simple grid of letters.
