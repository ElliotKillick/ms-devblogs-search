        C++/WinRT provides a pair of functions for converting between UTF-8 strings (with code units represented as char) and UTF-16 strings (code units of wchar_t).
The to_string function takes a std::wstring_view of UTF-16 code units and converts them to a UTF-8 string, represented as a std::string.
Conversely, the to_hstring function takes a std::string_view of UTF-8 code units and converts them to a UTF-16 string, represented as a winrt::hstring.
The argument to to_string and to_hstring can be anything convertible to the corresponding string view type. Types that fall into this category include



Type
Converts to


std::string
std::string_view


std::wstring
std::wstring_view


winrt::hstring
std::wstring_view



Weâ€™ll put these conversions to good use next time.
