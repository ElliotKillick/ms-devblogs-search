        The Mesa (Arizona) Police Department reminds us in a press release that  9-1-1 is for emergencies, and the inability to watch Jay Leno due to a power outage does not qualify as an emergency.
 (Noting, because everybody else will, that this is not the same as the unconfirmed of the woman who  called 9-1-1 for a cheeseburger emergency.)
