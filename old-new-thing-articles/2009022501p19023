         Rumors swirl that there’s a movie version of The A-Team in the works. If they haven’t decided on the casting yet, here’s an option they may have overlooked:  The cast of Star Trek. 
 (I like how in the clips used in the fake trailer, they use one of an episode where Kirk is old. And in Hollywood, making a character older means graying their hair. They never gain weight when they age,  unlike the actors themselves.)
