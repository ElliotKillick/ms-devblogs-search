        Some friends came down to visit from  Vancouver to take advantage of the favorable exchange rate, and when the topic of lunch arose, one of them suggested Vietnamese sandwiches.
 “What are Vietnamese sandwiches?” I asked.
 “Okay, that settles it. We’re having Vietnamese sandwiches for lunch,” was the response.
 We went to the generically-named  Seattle Deli and ordered our sandwiches. (I had the chicken.)
 For less than three dollars I was rewarded with a wonderful sandwich. Crisp French bread around a collection of vegetables, some spicy, some pickled, some fresh, but all crispy, contrasting with the softness of the promised meat.
 It’s a fantastic dining experience. Too bad there are no Vietnamese sandwich shops near work.
