        During the preparations for the 2005 PDC, I was filling out an application for a corporate credit card. (The rant behind why I was filling out this application in the first place will have to wait for another day.) One of the options was to check a box to request rush processing at an additional charge of $10.
 There was one key piece of information missing: How much faster is rush processing compared to regular processing?
 I needed the card in three weeks. The web site didn’t say how long normal processing took. It didn’t say how long rush processing took. It just asked me if I wanted to pay extra to go faster.
 I took my chances and decided not to request rush processing. The confirmation page included the standard information, giving me an order number and confirming various bits of information that I had previously entered. And then it said, “This will typically take 7 to 10 business days.”
 Thanks a lot for giving me that crucial information after it’s too late for me to do anything about it. Fortunately, ten days was plenty of time.
