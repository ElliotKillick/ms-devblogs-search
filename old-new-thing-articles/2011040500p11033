Here’s a snippet of code whose job is to generate a unique number
within the process.

Here’s some reference reading to get yourself in the mood.
Caution: It may or may not be useful.



dwUniqueId = InterlockedCompareExchange(&g_dwUniqueId,
                                        g_dwUniqueId+1,
                                        g_dwUniqueId);
