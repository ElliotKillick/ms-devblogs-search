        Here are some subject lines I’ve seen over the past few years (suitably redacted):

!!! BLOCK WRITING TO CD DRIVE !!! 
___] Kernel objects naming convention [___ 
[QQ] – Question about job objects 

 Sure, using exclamation points, all capital letters, or strange eye-catching punctuation marks makes it easier for you to spot replies to your message in your inbox, but it’s also rude to your readers, who almost certainly do not consider your message as important as you do.
 Imagine if everybody did this.
 If it’s that important that it easy for you to spot replies to your message, set up a mail filter rule that highlights them.
 And, just because I collect these things, here are some unhelpful subject lines that I’ve seen in the past six months: 

need help 
Need help! 
customer question

SR# 1 – 61803399

Is this a bug? 
Microsoft question 
Vista question 
Questions about using Vista 
Quick Question! 
Customer Question 
here’s my question for the XYZ team 

 Sometimes, the people who commit the sin of the useless subject line also follow up with the second sin of  repeating their question verbatim because nobody answered it. Nobody answered it because the subject line was not obviously in anybody’s specific area of expertise.
