         It’s that time again: Sending some link love to my colleagues. 

          James O’Neill     tells a story about          a very strange design for an award from the British Safety Council. 
          Microspotting          interviews Dare Obasanjo.     He handles those     “Hello, I am a Nigerian government official, and I need your help”     messages differently from you and me. 
          The Security Vulnerability Research & Defense blog     contains “bonus information” about security bulletins.     Think of it as the director’s commentary track. 
     Yes, we know things are rainy in Seattle,     but          the mountain’s name is pronounced ray-NEER     even though it does look like something else. 
          John Guin     confirms:     “All the stories you hear about tech support calls are true.     All of them.” 
          Eric Lippert     reminds us that          string hashes are not for cryptographic purposes. 
          Mark Brown’s Virtual Earth Blog     pays a visit to          the people who fly the UltraCam,     that thing that gets those high resolution aerial images.     See the software they use to control the camera,     and if you ask nicely,     they might even take you for a ride.     Mark also has          a nice picture of the UltraCam itself. 
     On          The Debugging Toolbox,     Roberto Farah      takes a break from cooking up          PowerDbg scripts     to show some          fancy tricks you can play with the dv command.     Plenty of other debugging tips on that site,     so check it out.          Doug Stewart     has his own          collection of links to debugging resources. 
          Michael Howard     goes into more detail about          what sort of heap corruption is treated as fatal     if you          set HeapEnableTerminationOnCorruption.     Of course, this list may change as new types of corruption-detection     are added, but it’s a start. 
          Terry Zink     blogs about the world of email spam,     including a massive          18-part series on backscatter. 
     Dennis Middleton, the self-proclaimed NTFS Doctor,     explains          why the Size on disk and     Used space appear to disagree. 
     The          Environment folks have their own blog for     computing and the environment,     titled          Software Enabled Earth.          Nick Mayhew     calls out          some of his favorite parts. 
     The          Live Search Webmaster Center Blog     introduces you to the basics of          seeing how Live Search crawls your site     and what steps you can take to help it do a better job. 
          James Whittaker     tackles the thorny question,          If Microsoft is so good at testing, why does your software suck? 
          Better than epoxy:          Chris Chalmers’s e-Discovery     covers new group policies to give administrators better control     over USB thumb drives. 
          Adrian Vinca     has shared a personal programming project written just to learn     about XNA, but it sounds useful in its own right:          Zune Clock 1.5.     (Earlier versions also available.) 
          Alfred Thompson     helps us          find old Office commands on the new ribbon. 
          Tom Mertens          points to     an instructional video showing          how to write your own Windows Live Messenger agent.     Now I’m tempted to write one,     even though I have nothing for my agent to do…     (Smarter people than me have created a     .) 
     The          Office Natural Language Team     explain          how you can remove a word from Office’s speller dictionary.     Earlier this year, there was also an article in the local newspaper on          the day-to-day decisions by the people who maintain the list of     words in the spell-check dictionary.     Bonus reading:          A run-down of the process,     and          reader feedback. 
          Scott Hanselman     shares          the history of the Windows Template Library (WTL). 
     Joseph Conway explains          what the WINSXS directory is, and why it’s so huge. 
     If you aren’t subscribed to the          Engineering Windows 7 blog,     then stop right now and go subscribe. I’ll wait.     
          Okay, you’re back. There’s bucketloads of awesome stuff in there,     in particular Ryan Haveson’s second follow-up on          high DPI     points out why vectors don’t solve everything.
