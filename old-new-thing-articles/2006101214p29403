         The Airbus A380 will be the largest-capacity commercial passenger plane, once they get around to making them.  Now two years behind schedule, the A380 is not making life any easier for their parent company EADS. And in this two-player world,  bad news for Airbus means good news for Boeing. 
 As a Seattleite, I naturally root for Boeing over Airbus. After all, Boeing started here (even if they did  move to Chicago a few years ago), and many people forget that they are easily the largest single technology company in the Seattle area, with twice as many local employees as Microsoft.
