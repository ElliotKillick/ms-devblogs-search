        In another installment of  I bet somebody got a really nice bonus for that feature, I submit this question for your consideration.
 My customer wants to know how to lock a specific icon to the upper left hand corner of the desktop. 
 This company must be writing the most awesome program to end all programs, a program so amazingly awesome that it should appear as the very first thing on the desktop so you wonâ€™t forget how awesome it is.
 I think their users may disagree with that assessment.
 And the answer is, no, there is no supported way to force a particular icon to appear at a particular desktop position.
