          Ken Levine has written for some of the most well-known television programs of the past few decades. M*A*S*H, Cheers (for which he won an Emmy), Frasier. And that’s not counting his second (third? fourth?) career as a baseball announcer. He writes about whatever is on his mind, be it  Barry Bonds’ 715th home run,  what not to put into your television script,  more Cheers trivia than you know what to do with, or  Thanksgiving travel tips, and every single one is filled with his personality and attitude. It’s a joy to read.
