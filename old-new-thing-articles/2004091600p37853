         The RegexOptions.ECMAScript flag changes the behavior of .NET regular expressions. One of the changes I had discussed earlier was with respect to  matching digits. For those who want to know more,  a summary of the differences is documented in MSDN under the devious title “ECMAScript vs. Canonical Matching Behavior”. 
 Apparently some people had trouble finding that page, so I figured I’d point to it explicitly.
