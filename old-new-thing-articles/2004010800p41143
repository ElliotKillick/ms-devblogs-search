        Like everybody else, I was checking out the new MSN home page and I clicked over to the tour. And right there as their top headline in the sample web page, it says, “Wierd items of the future”.
Ahem. It’s spelled w-e-i-r-d.
And on all of the MSN properties, like local city guides, you can see MSN’s new motto: “More Useful Everyday”.
Um, another spelling error. That should read “More Useful Every Day”. When used as a single word, “everyday” is an adjective, not an adverb. Like “An everyday event”.
I’ll stick with My Yahoo, thanks the same. At least they know how to spell.
