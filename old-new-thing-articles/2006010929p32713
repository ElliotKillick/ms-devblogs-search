         Stephen Toub from MSDN Magazine alerts us to  the MSJ subscription scam. Somebody has been sending out (via paper mail) a fake subscription offer for  Microsoft Systems Journal, a magazine that ceased publication back in 2000. Read Stephen’s article for more details as well as a copy of the scam letter itself. (The address for the “publisher” is a rented mailbox at a what appears to be a UPS Store in the Beaumont Centre mall.) Under no circumstances send these people any money!
