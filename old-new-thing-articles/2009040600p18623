Commenter Frans Bouma asks,



Why is the text of a treenode chopped off
when you switch the font from normal to bold?

It apparently is for backwards compatibility
but I fail to see why this is necessary for backward compatibility…


Actually, bold treeview items work just fine.
Watch:


Start with our 

scratch program
and make these changes:


BOOL
OnCreate(HWND hwnd, LPCREATESTRUCT lpcs)
{
  g_hwndChild = CreateWindow(
      WC_TREEVIEW, NULL, WS_CHILD | WS_VISIBLE | WS_TABSTOP |
      TVS_HASBUTTONS | TVS_HASLINES | TVS_LINESATROOT,
      0, 0, 0, 0, hwnd, (HMENU)1, g_hinst, 0);
  TVINSERTSTRUCT tvis;
  tvis.hParent = TVI_ROOT;
  tvis.hInsertAfter = TVI_LAST;
  tvis.item.mask = TVIF_TEXT | TVIF_STATE;
  tvis.item.stateMask = TVIS_BOLD;
  tvis.item.state = 0;
  tvis.item.pszText = TEXT(“First”);
  tvis.hParent = TreeView_InsertItem(g_hwndChild, &tvis);
  tvis.item.pszText = TEXT(“Second”);
  tvis.item.state = TVIS_BOLD;
  TreeView_InsertItem(g_hwndChild, &tvis);
  tvis.item.pszText = TEXT(“Third”);
  tvis.item.state = 0;
  TreeView_InsertItem(g_hwndChild, &tvis);
  return TRUE;
}


I elided error checking for expository purposes.


This code creates a tree view and populates it as follows:


First

Second
Third



When you run this program, you can see that the text for all
the items appears as expected; nothing is truncated.


As for the backward compability remark,
it’s quite simple:
Every change, no matter how seemingly insignificant,
has compatibility consequences.
The common controls are heavily used in third party programs,
many of which make strange assumptions about how the controls work,
relying on quirks of implementations in strange ways.
For example,
those who have read

the first bonus chapter of my book
will know that even something as seemingly harmless as
fixing a flicker bug in the status bar resulted in
a broken status bar in a program from a major software publisher.
Every change is taken with great trepidation, and the bias is
to preserve bug-for-bug compatibility.


In this case, the issue was with the way the width of the treeview
item is calculated.
You can easily imagine programs which worked around the existing behavior
by artificially padding the item with spaces to compensate for
the miscalculation.
If the treeview suddenly fixed the bug,
these treeview items would now be undesirably large,
possibly creating a horizontal scroll bar where there previously
had been none, resulting in 
bugs like “After upgrading, the last item in my treeview is
being covered by a scroll bar.”
We saw something like this before when we looked at

the effects of the DS_SHELLFONT dialog style:
Fixing the bug described in that article would result in property
sheet pages coming out undesirably large (because their sizes were
artificially inflated to compensate for the erroneous calculation).


That doesn’t mean the bug can’t get fixed, however.
Just as the DS_SHELLFONT flag is a signal to say
that your property sheet page wants to use the new calculations,
you can tell the tree view
“Please give me the version of the treeview that fixes the
font bug” by sending it the CCM_SETVERSION message
and specifying that you want version 5.
Similarly, you can opt into version 6 of the common controls
by providing a manifest.


Update:
I slipped a subtlety into this article which

it appears people didn’t pick up on,
so I’ll make it explicit.


The original question was about “switching the font from normal to bold”,
but there are multiple ways of doing this.
My sample code used the recommended (declarative) method of setting the
TVIS_BOLD flag.
But if you click through the link, you’ll see that
the original commenter was using the procedural method of
handling the NM_CUSTOMDRAW notification,
selecting a new font
(a boldface variation of the normal font),
and returning CRF_NEWFONT.
This is a technique I had illustrated previously with

list views
and

tool tips.


The compatibility behavior is for fonts customized via
NM_CUSTOMDRAW.
The declarative method was added specifically to address the bug
in item size calculations when people change the font procedurally:
Older versions of the treeview control asked for the custom font
only when painting; it didn’t ask for the custom font when measuring.
Adding the font query to version 6 was actually quite risky,
since the only way to ask the application for the procedurally-applied
font is to actually go through the motions of drawing it,
generating a

dummy NM_CUSTOMDRAW notification
with an empty paint rectangle.
If an application painted outside the rectangle, you would have seen
seen random painting on the screen.
