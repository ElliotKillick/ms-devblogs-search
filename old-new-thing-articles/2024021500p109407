        A customer wanted to register a file extension with a complex command line that goes beyond simple string insertion.

When the user double-clicks a *.xyz file, we want it to run the Contoso program not only with the file name as a command line, but also with an additional command line argument that is a transformation of the file name.
For example, if the user double-clicks C:\Users\Chris\Awesome.xyz, we want to run the command line
"C:\Program Files\Contoso\contoso.exe" -exceptions C:\Users\Chris\Awesome.exceptions C:\Users\Chris\Awesome.xyz

if a file Awesome.exceptions exists in the same directory as Awesome.xyz. Otherwise, just launch it without the bonus -exceptions option.
We tried using %~dpn1.exceptions, but that just produces the percent sign and stuff. And it still doesn’t deal with testing whether the exceptions file exists.

The command line is just a command line with insertions. It is not a programming language. If you want a programming language, you’ll have to write a program.
For example, you could write a batch file that looks for a .exceptions file in the same directory as the file whose name was passed on the command line, and then run the contoso.exe program appropriately based on what you discover.
@echo off
if exist "%~dpn1.exceptions" (
    echo "C:\Program Files\Contoso\contoso.exe" -exceptions "%~dpn1.exceptions" "%1"
) else (
    echo "C:\Program Files\Contoso\contoso.exe" "%1"
)

You can then use this batch file as the command line.
"C:\Program Files\Contoso\Contoso-launcher.cmd" "%1"

Of course, this will display a command prompt briefly. You can write a program in a non-console language if that bothers you. At this point, the problem has been reduced to computer programming.
