        A customer had a Web service that runs processes as specific users. There may be multiple such processes running at the same time for a single user account. Here are the questions. And just to be nice, I’ve even included the answers. (Note: These are not my answers. I’m just recording them for posterity.) 
“Is there a limit to the number of Logon­User sessions that can exist at a time for a particular user?” 
It is limited by available memory. 
“Once the process exits, what kind of cleanup do we need to  perform? We don’t see a Logoff­User function.” 
When you are done, take the token handle that you got from Logon­User and pass it to Close­Handle. 
“Is there a recommended way to run multiple processes under the same user account?” 
When you get a token from Logon­User, use that one token for multiple processes.
