         Shankar Vedantam  wrote a Washington Post article and also  appeared on NPR to discuss  The Decoy Effect: Given a choice between two options, introducing a third, clearly inferior, option can influence your original decision. You wonâ€™t pick the third option, but a clever choice of the bad third option can sway the decision toward either of the other two. 
 Rationally, an inferior third option should have no effect on your choice between the two other options, but psychologists (and marketing majors) have discovered that human beings are not rational decision makers. (Anyone who has interacted with a two-year-old child is already well aware of this.)
