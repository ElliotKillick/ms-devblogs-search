        A customer asked 
We’re using the Property­Sheet function to create a wizard. We’ve been able to remove almost all of the wizard elements, but we can’t figure out how to get rid of the footer area. Is there a way to get rid of that? 
The customer included a picture of what they were talking about, with the offending area highlighted:

Um, that footer area is where the Back/Next buttons go. If you remove the navigation buttons, then what you have isn’t really a wizard any more. 
What you’ve got there is a dialog box. 
So use a dialog box. 
You’ve ordered a cheeseburger and are trying to remove every last bit of cheese. Don’t do that. Just order a hamburger if that’s what you want.
