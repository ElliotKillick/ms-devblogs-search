        The

Corporate Citizenship Tools; Microsoft Local Language Program
Web site contains a map of the world, coded by region.
There was a bug on the map.
See if you can spot it:




    
    

      Asia
      Europe
      Middle East & Africa
      North America
      South America
      South Pacific
    



After I pointed out the error, they fixed the map on their Web page,
so
no fair clicking through to the Local Language Program Web page
and comparing the pictures!


Non-useful hint:
I chose the publication date of this quiz in honor of the answer.


Bonus chatter: Inside the answer.


Iceland is drawn in the color of North America rather than Europe.
Here’s the corrected map:



The non-useful hint is that I posted this quiz on the Friday
before

Icelandic National Day.


Bonus chatter:
The colors are based on the categorization in the
“Select your location” box under the map.
And in that combo box, Iceland is listed under Europe.
(Russia is listed under both.)
