        In the wildlife documentary A Day at the Fire Station, Mr. Vesuvio the fox thanks the pig fire fighters for saving his pizzeria by serving them lunch. Lunch consists of a pizza with various toppings: Tomato, anchovies, basil, and bacon. 
Mr. Vesuvio may want to leave off the bacon next time.
