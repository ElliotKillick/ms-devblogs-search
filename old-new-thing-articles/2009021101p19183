        Normally, the phrase In order to serve you better means that  you’re  about to  get screwed.
 Imagine my surprise to discover that  United has stopped imposing a fuel surcharge for flights between Canada and the United States due to the decrease in fuel prices. But wait, that’s only for flights between Canada and the United States. Flights within the United States appear to have the surcharge in place as usual. 
 Hey, I’ve got an idea. How about getting rid of this surcharge nonsense and just raise the price of the ticket? Naw, that’s just crazy talk. 
 I can see the  Calvin & Hobbes cartoon already. “Lemonade, 5¢ a glass (plus 25¢ water surcharge, 50¢ sugar surcharge, 75¢ rent reclamation fee, $1.50  Moe appeasement fee, 25¢ capital depreciation fee…)”
