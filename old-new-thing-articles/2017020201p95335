Friendly Police Department Tip #001 – Nightly Nude Jogging:  
On Jan 27th at 3:30am, an officer on the south side of a large corporate campus near 15320 NE 40 St observed an unknown male running outside. After seeing nude buttocks illuminated by a street light, she and another officer contacted the jogger, who was wearing nothing but black Sketcher sneakers. Concerned for the cold weather, he was placed in a patrol vehicle.  
When questioned, he stated “he was trying to build up his immune system to fight the cold weather”.  
In case you weren’t aware, nude jogging could be considered indecent exposure. In this instance, he was not charged, as there were no victims. 
We do not have pictures to share of this incident. You are welcome.
