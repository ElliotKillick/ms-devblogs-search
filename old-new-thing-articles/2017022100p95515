        Every so often, somebody reports that whenever they open a command prompt, they get a weird error message between the version banner and the prompt. 
Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.14393](c) 2016 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect.
C:\> 
Where is that message “The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect” coming from? 
My psychic powers tell me that it’s coming from AutoRun. 
AutoRun is a hidden gotcha of the command processor which lets you set a registry key to inject a command into every command prompt as soon as it starts up. And I’m guessing that there’s a rogue AutoRun entry that is doing something which is generating that message. 
For example, I was able to reproduce the message by doing this: 

reg add "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor" /v AutoRun /d \"C:|

After running this command, open a command prompt, and you’ll get that same error message. 
And before you forget, run this command to get rid of the bogus AutoRun: 

reg delete "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor" /v AutoRun /f
