        In case those coming into town for the  2005 MVP Global Summit were interesting in chatting with me, here’s my event diary for this week. (Non-native-English-speaking MVPs can hover over the highlighted words for a translation from slang into “standard American-English”.)

Even though it’s not affiliated with the MVP Global Summit,     I’ll mention it anyway since it happens the same week:     I’ll be at CodeSlam on Tuesday night.     The name is a play on          Poetry Slam, but     instead of reciting poetry, you share your code.     If you’re an MVP with a cool app you want to contribute     to CodeGallery,     and you want to be part of the biggest geek     slumber party in Redmond, let me know.     I can bring one guest.     (However, since I am old and decrepit and have a job to go to the     following morning, I probably won’t last the whole night.) 
I am trying to          finagle     a ticket to the Windows Shell/User MVP dinner     on Thursday evening. 
If I can’t get a ticket to the MVP dinner, I’ll definitely          crash     the Windows Shell/User MVP lunch on Friday. 
I’ll          pop by     the MVP Barbecue on Saturday to          touch base     with the MVPs in disciplines other than Windows Shell/User. 

 If you want to be sure to catch me,  drop me a line and I’ll try to make time to see you. Note, however, that I’m doing this outside of my “regular job”, so please be a bit understanding if a work emergency forces me to do some last-minute rescheduling. 
 [Colors fixed 8:30am; sorry I was half-asleep when I wrote this entry.]
