        While you wait for me to write the Alpha AXP processor architecture overview,¹ I’d like to direct your attention to the ARM processor architecture overview written up by Marion Cole over at the NT Debugging blog. I hope that’ll keep you busy for a little while longer. 

        Understanding ARM Assembly Part 1:     Processor features. 
        Understanding ARM Assembly Part 2:     How Windows uses the processor. 
        Understanding ARM Assembly Part 3:     Calling conventions. 
¹ Spoiler alert: Don’t hold your breath.
