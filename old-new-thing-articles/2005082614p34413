         Marymoor Park just keeps getting better.
 Just this year, they added  a little Subway sandwich shop, so you donâ€™t even have to pack for a picnic in the park. Next,  free Wi-Fi (sponsored by MSN). Then  movies in the park (sponsored by First Tech Credit Union). 
 The latest addition is  free bicycles (sponsored by Dasani). Show a photo ID and you get a cardkey that gives you access to one-speed coaster-brake bicycles you can borrow for the day.
