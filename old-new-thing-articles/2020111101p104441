        My general strategy for playing Settlers of Catan is to take my unused road, settlement, and city tokens and try to build a robot out of them.
I have yet to win with this strategy, but I like it nevertheless.
(I don’t buy many development cards because I haven’t figured out how to use them to build a robot.)
