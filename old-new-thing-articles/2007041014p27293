         Taiwanese Bluetooth technology company Bluetake has an odd picture on their front page. It’s three women drinking alcohol, with plenty more bottles in front of them. Not a single Bluetooth device in sight. Maybe Bluetooth just makes alcohol taste better. 
 (Yes, I know it’s a stock photo, but what’s with the alcohol?)
