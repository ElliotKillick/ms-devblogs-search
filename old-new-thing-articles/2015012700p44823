        Once upon a time, a senior manager held a team meeting to address low team morale. Attempting to highlight how important the project was, he opened by saying, “I just got back from 〈faraway country〉, meeting with some of our important clients, and…”
 This remark had exactly the opposite effect from what the manager intended. Instead of revitalizing the team, the team became even more despondent. “Here we are, working late and coming in on weekends, and this senior manager is telling us about his recent overseas junket.”
 (After he left, I heard that he still pulled this stunt with his new team. “Over the past two weeks, I’ve been all over 〈continent〉…”)
