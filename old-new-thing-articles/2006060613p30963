        From the reactions to my entry on  driving in Taiwan, it appears that driving is pretty messed up all over Asia. Here’s  a video of driving in India that was popular a while back.
  This comment comparing Taiwan driving to the Philippines reminded me of a conversation I had with some Filipino tourists when I was in Taiwan. We were on a bus as it was negotiating traffic, and I asked them, “Is driving in the Philippines as crazy as here in Taiwan?”
 They answered, “Oh, no. It’s much crazier.”
