          Robert Scoble    blogs from the Microsoft company picnic.  Although he writes,  “Microsoft holds a picnic for its employees every year,”  this suggests that the picnic is organized by Microsoft.  It isn’t.   
  The company picnic is run by a professional company picnic  company.  They also do    the Alaska Airlines company picnic,  and probably those of many    other organizations who don’t put their  picnic information on the public Internet.  Wander down to Mountain Meadows Farm any weekend during the summer  and you’re likely to see a picnic or other group event under way.
