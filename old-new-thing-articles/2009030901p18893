         At lunch, we got the crazy idea of putting together a meal menu consisting entirely of foods which had been the subject of highly-publicized product recalls. And of course, we gave it a name consisting of a really bad pun:  Totally Recall. 

 Starter 
  Green leaf lettuce with  tomatoes,  green onions, and  jalapeno peppers. 
 Main course 
 Swimming Rama:  Spinach with  peanut sauce and stir-fried  beef. 
 Beverage 
  Odwalla juice. 
 Dessert 
 ? Suggestions welcome. (White Rabbit candies?) 

 And if you donâ€™t like this meal, you can just go to the  Jack in the Box restaurant down the street.
