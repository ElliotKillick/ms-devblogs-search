        A customer found that even though they set the hypervisorlaunchtype to off in the boot configuration, and they unchecked Hyper-V in the Turn Windows features on or off dialog, they found that hypervisor was still enabled. As a result, Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager refuses to create a 64-bit guest. 
Someone from the kernel team explained that the hypervisor might still be enabled in the UEFI, so thatâ€™s one thing to check. 
Another thing that will force the hypervisor on is Virtualization-Based Security, which goes by the acronym VBS. This is confusing because to most people VBS stands for VBScript.
