         Now that Wikipedia has catapulted the wiki into the general consciousness, where there’s a wiki, a spoof of a wiki can’t be far behind. 

          Uncyclopedia     is the alternate-universe          Wikipedia.     Consider, for example,          what it has to say about     the television show Heroes. 
          Smugopedia. You think you’re so great.     (Not actually a wiki, but I had to put it somewhere.) 
          Frakr,     a parody of          Battlestar Wiki. 
          Wikiality     brings          truthiness to the Web.
