Ultimately,
you can’t stop somebody from ignoring the words
Confidential at the top of a document and

whipping out a digital camera
and taking a picture of the screen.
But at least
starting in Windows 7
you can make it a little more difficult.


Take our

scratch program
and add this one line:


    …
    SetWindowDisplayAffinity(hwnd, WDA_MONITOR);
    ShowWindow(hwnd, nShowCmd);
    …


Assuming you have the Desktop Window Manager enabled,
you will find that
attempting to capture our scratch program in a screenshot
or via the Snipping Tool
will result in black pixels.


Remember, this is just an obstacle, not a security measure.
If somebody is determined to get the pixels,
this step is only going to slow them down a little.
(For example,
on Windows 7, they can simply disable the Desktop Window Manager.)
But it’s handy for reducing the likelihood of an accidental
breach of confidential information.


Pre-emptive hate:
“DRM is evil!”
My response to you: If you don’t like DRM,
then don’t buy DRM-protected content.
If you don’t like IRM,
then don’t read IRM-protected documents.
If you don’t like Blu-Ray,
then don’t buy Blu-Ray DVDs.
