         A colleague of mine stopped by my office to tell me that he got a telephone call from his father in Poland asking him  why Microsoft sunk Poland. My colleague was somewhat baffled by this question, since his father isn’t a computer nerd, but his father explained that he saw the story on the front page of the newspaper. Apparently,  the story ran in the largest Polish newspaper, but it doesn’t appear that they credited their source, demonstrating that quality journalism is hard to find in any country. My guess is that the jump into Poland came from  this page, which does credit my article. I’m just guessing, though, since I can’t read Polish. 
 I just found it weird to see my stuff spreading all the way to general-audience newspapers in Poland.
