         As a follow-up to  my tip on speeding up connecting via RAS and a SmartCard, I’ve been told that another trick you can do is to disable your wireless networking card before initiating the VPN connection. Wireless networking cards are a huge attack surface, and the VPN software spends a lot of time trying to secure it. 
 I don’t have a wireless networking card on the machine I use at home to connect to the work network, so I haven’t tried it, but who knows, maybe it’ll work for you.
