        I have a strange tendency to  misread newspaper headlines. This week, I read the headline  Rogan Sets 200 Back World Record, and I thought, “There’s a world record for running 200 meters backward?”
 Well,  actually there is, but this article was actually about the 200 meter backstroke (swimming).
 Once I figured that out, I was not confused by the next headline:  Lochte Sets 100 IM World Record.
