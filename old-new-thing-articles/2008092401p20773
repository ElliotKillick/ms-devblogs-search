         Like the NFL, the NBA has its own  Rookie Transition Program for introducing new players to important issues such as life skills, money management, dealing with the media, and the importance of character and image in avoiding public embarrassment. Apparently it took longer than usual for these lessons to sink in for Mario Chalmers and Darrell Arthur, since they were  caught in their hotel room with two unspecified women, and security claimed to have smelled marijuana although none was found.  They were fined $20,000 apiece, and  a fellow player was fined $50,000 for his involvement and failure to cooperate with the investigation.
 The two players also were ordered to go through the training a second time. Maybe this time, theyâ€™ll learn something. 
 Follow-up:  ESPN has a summary of events. Fire alarm. Refusing to let security into the room. Repeated toilet flushing. Gotta love it.
