A customer reported having problems with the
SH­Get­Known­Folder­Path function.
I’ve left in the red herrings.



On Windows 7, I’m trying to retrieve the Internet folder
with the following code:


if (OpenProcessToken(GetCurrentProcess(), TOKEN_ALL_ACCESS, &hToken))
{
 HRESULT hr = SHGetKnownFolderPath(FOLDERID_InternetFolder,
                              KF_FLAG_DONT_VERIFY, hToken, &pszPath);
 ...
}


The call always fails with E_FAIL.
What am I doing wrong?
I tried passing NULL as the token, but that didn’t help.



The reason the call fails has nothing to do with Windows 7
or the token.
The call fails because FOLDERID_Internet­Folder is
a virtual folder—there is no path in the first place!


The reason is that the folder you are requesting is a virtual
folder (KF_CATEGORY_VIRTUAL).
Virtual folders don’t exist in the file system, so they don’t have a path.
SH­Get­Known­Folder­Item should work.


The customer appears to have misinterpreted this response
in a way I wasn’t expecting
(but which sadly

I’ve seen before):



I added the KF_CATEGORY_VIRTUAL flag, but I still
get the same error back.


if (OpenProcessToken(GetCurrentProcess(), TOKEN_ALL_ACCESS, &hToken))
{
 HRESULT hr = SHGetKnownFolderPath(FOLDERID_InternetFolder,
                              KF_FLAG_DONT_VERIFY | KF_CATEGORY_VIRTUAL,
                              hToken, &pszPath);
 ...
}



Um, no, that makes no sense at all.
KF_CATEGORY_VIRTUAL
is a KF_CATEGORY
value, but the second parameter to
SH­GetKnown­Folder­Path
is a KNOWN_FOLDER_FLAG.
You can’t just combine unrelated values like that.
It’s like

adding 3 grams to 12 meters.


And second, the KF_CATEGORY_VIRTUAL enumeration isn’t
something that you pass in to “override” anything.
The point is that FOLDERID_Internet­Folder is a virtual
folder: It has no path, so if you try to ask for its path, you’ll
just get an error back because the thing you’re looking for
simply doesn’t exist.


I never did figure out what this customer was trying to do.
Maybe they figured, since they can’t

download the Internet,
they could at least try to do a
Find­First­File on it.
