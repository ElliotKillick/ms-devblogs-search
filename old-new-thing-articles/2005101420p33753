         Why is the path separator on Japanese Windows the ¥ character? And why is it the ₩ character on Korean Windows? I’ve been prodding  Michael Kaplan to delve into the history of this quirk, and  he finally gave in to my repeated badgering. (Additional discussion on the  Korean Won sign, the  Japanese Yen sign, and  currency symbols in general.)
