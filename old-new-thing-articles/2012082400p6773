I was doing some crash dump debugging, as I am often called upon to do,
and one of the data structure I had to grovel through was something
that operated basically like an atom table, so that’s what I’ll call
it.
Like an atom table,
it manages a collection of strings.
You can add a string to the table (getting a unique value back,
which we will call an atom),
and later you can hand it the atom and it will give you the string back.
It looked something like this:


struct ENTRY
{
  ENTRY *next;
  UINT   atom;
  PCWSTR value;
};
#define ATOMTABLESIZE 19
struct ATOMTABLE
{
  ENTRY *buckets[ATOMTABLESIZE];
};


(It didn’t actually look like this; I’ve reduced it to the smallest
example that still illustrates my point.)


As part of my debugging, I had an atom and needed to look it up
in the table.
A program would do this by simply calling the
“here is an atom, please give me the string” function,
but since this was a crash dump,
there’s nothing around to execute anything.
(Not that having a live machine would’ve made things much easier,
because this was a kernel-mode crash,
so you don’t get any of this edit-and-continue froofy stuff.
This is real debugging™.)


But even though the crashed system can’t execute anything,
the debugger can execute stuff,
and the debugger engine used by kd
comes with its own mini-programming language.
Here’s how I dumped the atom table:


// note: this was entered all on one line
// broken into two lines for readability
0: kd&gt .for (r $t0=0; @$t0 < 0n19; r $t0=@$t0+1)
         { dl poi (fffff8a0`06b69930+@$t0*8) 99 2 }
fffff8a0`06ad3b90  fffff8a0`037a3fc0 fffff8a0`0000000c \
fffff8a0`037a3fc0  fffff8a0`037a4ae0 00000000`00000025 | $t0=0
fffff8a0`037a4ae0  fffff8a0`02257580 00000000`00000036 |
fffff8a0`02257580  00000000`00000000 00000000`00000056 /
fffff8a0`06ad3b30  fffff8a0`06ad3ad0 a9e8a9d8`0000000d \
fffff8a0`06ad3ad0  fffff8a0`037a4700 000007fc`0000000e |
fffff8a0`037a4700  fffff8a0`01f96fb0 00000000`0000003f | $t0=1
fffff8a0`01f96fb0  fffff8a0`06cfa5d0 fffff8a0`00000044 |
fffff8a0`06cfa5d0  00000000`00000000 00181000`00000060 /
fffff8a0`033e7a70  fffff8a0`037a4770 00000020`00000023 \
fffff8a0`037a4770  fffff8a0`023b52f0 00000000`0000003e | $t0=2
fffff8a0`023b52f0  fffff8a0`03b6e020 006f0063`00000059 |
fffff8a0`03b6e020  00000000`00000000 00000000`00000075 /
fffff8a0`037a0670  fffff8a0`02b08870 fffff8a0`00000026 \ $t0=3
fffff8a0`03b9e390  00000000`00000000 00240000`00000071 /
...


Let’s take that weirdo command apart one piece at a time.


The overall command is


.for (a; b; c) { d }


This operates the same as the C programming language.
(Sorry, Delphi programmers,
for yet another C-centric example.)
In our case,
we use the $t0 pseudo-register as our loop control.


r $t0=0
    — this sets $t0 to zero
@$t0 < 0n19
    — this stops once $t0 reaches 19.
r $t0=@$t0+1
    — this increments $t0.


Note that here as well as in the loop body, I prefix the register
name with the @ character when I want to obtain its value,
in order to force it to be interpreted as a register.
(Otherwise, the debugger will look for a symbol called $t0.)


The command being executed at each iteration is
{ dl poi (fffff8a0`06b69930+@$t0*8) 99 2 }.
Let’s break this down, too:


dl
    — this command dumps a singly-linked list.
poi (fffff8a0`06b69930+@$t0*8)
    — this is the head of the linked list.
    In this example,
    0xfffff8a0`06b69930
    is the address of the buckets array,
    so we add the loop counter times the size of a pointer (8, in
    this case) to get the address of the $t0‘th entry,
    and then dereference it (poi) to get the address
    of the head of the linked list.
99
    — This is the maximum length of the linked list.
    I picked an arbitrary large-enough number.
    I like using 9’s because it carries the most value per keypress.
    Other people like to use nice round numbers like 1000,
    but 999 saves you a whole keypress and is just one less.
    (On the other hand, I don’t use fff because that runs
    the risk of being misinterpreted as a symbol.)
2
    —
    This is the number of pointer-sized objects to dump at the start
    of each node.
    For 32-bit code, I use 4, whereas for 64-bit code, I use 2.
    Why those values?
    Because those are the maximum number of pointer-sized objects that
    the debugger will print on one line.


Okay, so now I have that linked list dump.
The value I’m looking for is the atom whose value
is 0x3F, so I skim down the last column looking
for 0000003f, and hey there it is.


fffff8a0`037a4700  fffff8a0`01f96fb0 00000000`0000003f


Now I have my ENTRY, and I can dump it to see what
the corresponding value is.


0: kd> dt contoso!ENTRY fffff8a0`037a4700
    +0x000 next: 0xfffff8a0`01f96fb0
    +0x008 atom: 0x0000003f
    +0x010 value: 0xffff8a0`01f97e20 -> "foo"
