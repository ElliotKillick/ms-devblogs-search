        A security vulnerability report came in that went roughly like this:
Copy a huge amount of text to the clipboard, like a half a gigabyte. Run the XYZ program and paste it all. The program crashes. This is a denial of service against program XYZ. A photo of the crash is attached.
First of all, the claim that the program crashes is incorrect. The photo shows that the cursor is a spinning donut, and the title bar says “(Not Responding)”. The program hasn’t crashed. It has stopped responding, probably because it’s busy trying to process a half-gigabyte of data. But, presumably, if you wait long enough, it will eventually finish (or run out of memory).
While it’s true that this could be considered a denial of service against program XYZ, it’s entirely self-inflicted. You chose to paste half a gigabyte of data into program XYZ, so you get to wait for it to finish.
Besides, if you wanted to launch a denial-of-service attack against program XYZ, there’s a much simpler way: Click the red “X” button in the upper right corner to close the program.
Now nobody can use it.
