         With  the loss of the Weekly World News, I’ll have to rely on the trustworthy Internet to keep me informed of government conspiracies. I happen to be partial to  4/29truth.com, which uncovers the strange coincidences and inconsistencies in the “official” explanation of the  tanker crash and fire on April 29, 2007 that destroyed a highway overpass in the San Francisco Bay Area. (This site is so noteworthy, even  The Los Angeles Times sang its praises.) 
 My favorite factoid: The only way Governor Schwarzenneger could have gotten to the scene in time  was if he was already en route when the explosion occurred, proving that the explosion was no accident.
