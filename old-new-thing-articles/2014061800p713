         While it may no longer be true that  everything at Microsoft is built using various flavors of Visual C++ 5.0, 6.0, and 7.0, there is still a kernel of truth in it: A lot of customers are still using Visual C++ 6.0. 
 That’s why the unofficial slogan for Visual C++ 2010 was  10 is the new 6. Everybody on the team got a T-shirt with the slogan (because you don’t have a product  until you have a T-shirt).
