         TipTalk wrote some time ago about the  urban legend of the Reading Pane. In the conclusion, the article mentions the “read all standard mail in plain text” setting. And that reminded me of a story.
 Some time ago, the IT department sent out a message to all users on the subject of email safety. The gist of the message was that for increased safety, everybody should go to that options dialog and check the box to set Outlook to read email in plain text mode. 
 It’s not clear whether they expected anybody to take their message seriously, though: They sent the message in HTML format.
