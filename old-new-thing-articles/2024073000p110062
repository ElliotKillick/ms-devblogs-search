        Somehow, there is a claim of  a 30-year mystery surrounding Microsoft’s Blue Screen of Death. The argument goes that there are three conflicting sources of authorship: Steve Ballmer, John Vert, and me.
But really, there is no conflict. There are three different blue-colored screens, and each has a different author.
First is  the Windows 3.1 Ctrl+Alt+Del screen, which is a blue screen of unhappiness, not death:



  
 
Contoso Deluxe Music Composer
 
 
  This Windows application has stopped responding to the system.
 
  *  Press ESC to cancel and return to Windows.
  *  Press ENTER to close this application that is not responding.
     You will lose any unsaved information in this application.
  *  Press CTRL+ALT+DEL again to restart your computer. You will
     lose any unsaved information in all applications.
 
 





The text for this message was written by Steve Ballmer. (He didn’t write the code to display the message; he just wrote the text that goes into the message.)
Windows 3.1 did not have a blue screen of death. If Windows crashed, you got  what could anachronistically be called a black screen of death:



Could not continue running Windows because of paging error.
 
C:\>_  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 



Next is the Windows 95 kernel error, which you could consider a “blue screen of death”, although Windows 95 lets you ignore the error, so it’s not a true death. (Then again, there’s no guarantee that ignoring the error will return you to a usable system.)




 
 Windows 

 
An exception 0D has occurred at 0028:80014812 in VxD CONTOSO(03) + 00000152. This was called from 0028:80014C34 in VxD CONTOSO(03) + 00000574. It may be possible to continue normally.
 
* Press any key to attempt to continue.
* Press CTRL+ALT+DEL to restart your computer. You will
  lose any unsaved information in all applications.




I was the one who brought this version of the Windows 95 kernel error blue screen message to its final form. (Some people have  misidentified an early version of it as a Windows NT blue screen.)
The third blue screen of death is the Windows NT kernel error, and  that’s the one authored by John Vert.

This is a true “blue screen of death”: The system is unrecoverably dead at this point.
So we have the following table:



OS
Author
Release year


Windows 3.1
Steve Ballmer (text)
1992


Windows 95
ends with me¹
1995


Windows NT
John Vert
1993



¹ I did not write the early version of the Windows 95 blue screen message, but I was the one who brought it to its final form.
