         Here are some phrases I jotted down during a meeting. I don’t even know what meeting it was. (They were jotted on some scratch paper.) These don’t count so much as Microspeak as they do just assorted management babble. 

“inspiring sustained high performance” 
“fostering agility and resilience” 
“clarifying the journey” 
“unleashing talent” 
“a new or unanticipated experiment” 

 Sometimes I wish management would speak in plain English. But then the rest of us might realize that they don’t know what they’re talking about.
