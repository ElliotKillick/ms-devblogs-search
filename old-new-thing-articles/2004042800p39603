        It appears that  I will have an opportunity to visit Sweden during the first  week of June.  I’ll have three days in Uppsala  and three days in Lund, with a travel day in between.  Now, I’ve already spent a week and a half in Uppsala,  so perhaps I could spend the Uppsala days taking a ferry  to Helsinki and back.  (And I could visit Denmark from Lund…)
  My Swedish won’t be any better  (well, okay, I learned a little more about formation of  past participles, not like that counts for much),  but I still enjoy trying.  The hard part is finding  someone patient enough to put up with all my fumbling  and not switch to English out of frustration.
  (In Finland and Denmark, I’m just going to start in English  with German as a fallback.  Sorry, guys.)
  The question facing me now is whether I should go.  It hasn’t even been a month since my previous trip,  and if the Finland thing doesn’t come together,  I’ll be spending half my time in a city I’ve already visited.  Hm…
