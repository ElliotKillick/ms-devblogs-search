         Blogger  Qrystal got hit with blog trackback spam and  did research into the phenomenon, even discovering the author trying to sell the spam blog. 
 And he had to cut the price because Google AdSense has cut him off. Ha, ha, haaahhhhh~! 
 (Read the blog entry for the spammerâ€™s for-sale offers and other linkity goodness.)
