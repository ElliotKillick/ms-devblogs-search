         The New Yorker reported some time ago on  how Navteq gathers map data. This story reminded me that, at least as of a few years ago, Navteq listed the driveway of a colleague of mine as a through road. Drivers came up to his driveway, realized that they’ve been hoodwinked, and spun their wheels in the gravel in frustration on their way out. 
 He told me that he had reported the error to Navteq three years previously, but they still hadn’t updated their map data. I haven’t checked back to see if the data has been updated yet…
