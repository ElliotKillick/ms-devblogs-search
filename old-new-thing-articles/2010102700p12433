        A customer wanted to know if there was a way for their application to invoke the  Aero Peek feature so that their window appeared and all the other windows on the system turned transparent.
 No, there is no such programmatic interface exposed. Aero Peek is a feature for the user to invoke, not a feature for applications to invoke so they can draw attention to themselves.
 Yes, I realize you wrote a program so awesome that all other programs pale in comparison, and that part of your mission is to make all the other programs literally pale in comparison to your program.
 Sorry.
 Maybe you can meet up with  that other program that is the most awesome program in the history of the universe and share your sorrows over a beer.
