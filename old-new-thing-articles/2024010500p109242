        A customer had a program that crashed with this stack:

They wondered if some recent change to Windows was the source of the problem, since it didn’t happen as much in earlier versions of Windows.
The stack trace pointed to Widget::IsEnabled, which was crashing on the first instruction because it was given an invalid this pointer.
00007fff`73a8a59f mov edx,dword ptr [rcx+40h]
                                    ds:00000000`00000040=????????

The Widget pointer came from a std::vector that is a member of the Standard­Widgets class.
using namespace Microsoft::WRL;

class StandardWidgets : RuntimeClass<IStandardWidgets, FtmBase>
{
    IFACEMETHODIMP get_TotalCost(INT32* result);
    ⟦ other methods not relevant here ⟧

private:
    HRESULT LazyInitializeWidgetList();

    static constexpr PCWSTR standardWidgetNames[] = {
        L"Bob", L"Carol", L"Ted", L"Alice" };
    static constexpr int standardWidgetCount =
        ARRAYSIZE(standardWidgetNames);

    std::vector<ComPtr<Widget>> m_widgets;
};

The code crashed at this call to Widget::GetCost:
IFACEMETHODIMP StandardWidgets::get_TotalCost(INT32* result)
{
    *result = 0;

    RETURN_IF_FAILED(LazyInitializeWidgetList());

    INT32 totalCost = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < standardWidgetCount; i++) {
        totalCost += m_widgets[i]->GetCost(); // here
    }
    *result = totalCost;
    return S_OK;
}

The customer’s debugging showed that at the point of the crash, not only was the widget garbage, but the m_widgets vector had an impossibly large number of elements. The m_widgets is expected to have only four widgets, but it somehow found itself with ten, and sometimes as many as a hundred widgets. Of course, they were nearly all corrupted.
Here’s the code that lazy-initializes the widget list:
HRESULT StandardWidgets::LazyInitializeWidgetList()
{
    // Early-out if already initialized.
    if (!m_widgets.empty()) {
        return S_OK;
    }

    // Lazy-create the vector of standard widgets
    try {
        m_widgets.reserve(standardWidgetCount);
        for (auto name : standardWidgetNames) {
            ComPtr<Widget> widget;
            RETURN_IF_FAILED(
                MakeAndInitialize<Widget>(&widget, name));
            m_widgets.push_back(widget);
        }
    } catch (std::bad_alloc const&) {
        return E_OUTOFMEMORY;
    }
    return S_OK;
}

The customer noted that the reserve method is always called with the value 4, and the code never pushes more than four items into the vector. They admitted that if there is a problem creating all four of the standard widgets, the vector could end up with fewer than four widgets, but it should never have more than four.
You already have multiple clues that point toward what the customer’s problem is. I’ll give you some time to think about it.
In the meantime, let’s look at other issues with how the code lazy-initializes the widget list.
As the customer noted, if there is a problem creating any of the four standard widgets, the failure is propagated to the caller of Lazy­Initialize­Widget­List, and get_TotalCost in turn propagates the error to its own caller, and it never gets to the point where it walks through the vector adding up all the costs.
If there is a memory allocation failure at the reserve(), or if there is a problem with the first standard widget, then the vector remains empty, and a second call to Lazy­Initialize­Widget­List will make a new attempt at initialization.
If there is a problem with the second or subsequent standard widget, however, things get weird. The Lazy­Initialize­Widget­List function returns a failure, which causes get_TotalCost to return failure. But the second time someone calls get_TotalCost, Lazy­Initialize­Widget­List will see a nonempty vector and assume that everything was initialized. This time, the get_TotalCost method will proceed with the summation and perform an out-of-bounds array access when it gets to the widget that failed to be created.
Oops.
This particular problem boils down to leaving a partially-initialized m_widgets if the lazy initialization fails. To avoid this problem, we should create the vector in a local variable and transfer it to the member variable only after we are sure all of the widgets were created successfully.
HRESULT StandardWidgets::LazyInitializeWidgetList()
{
    // Early-out if already initialized.
    if (!m_widgets.empty()) {
        return S_OK;
    }

    // Lazy-create the vector of standard widgets
    try {
        std::vector<ComPtr<Widget>> widgets;
        widgets.reserve(standardWidgetCount);
        for (auto name : standardWidgetNames) {
            ComPtr<Widget> widget;
            RETURN_IF_FAILED(
                MakeAndInitialize<Widget>(&widget, name));
            widgets.push_back(widget);
        }
        m_widgets.swap(widgets);
    } catch (std::bad_alloc const&) {
        return E_OUTOFMEMORY;
    }
    return S_OK;
}

This ensures that the m_widgets is either totally empty or totally initialized. It is never in a half-initialized state.
While we’re at it, we probably should convert the loop in get_TotalCost into a ranged for loop. Right now, get_Total­Cost has a hidden dependency on Lazy­Initialize­Widgets: It assumes that Lazy­Initialize­Widgets always creates exactly the number of widgets as there are standard­Widget­Names. Maybe in the future, you might want to suppress some of the standard widgets based on some configuration setting. If you add that configuration setting and forget to update get_Total­Cost to account for suppressed widgets, you will have an out-of-bounds index. All the logic to decide which widgets are standard should be local to Lazy­Initialize­Widgets.
IFACEMETHODIMP StandardWidgets::get_TotalCost(INT32* result)
{
    *result = 0;

    RETURN_IF_FAILED(LazyInitializeWidgetList());

    INT32 totalCost = 0;
    for (auto&& widget : m_widgets) {  
        totalCost += widget->GetCost();
    }                                  
    *result = totalCost;
    return S_OK;
}

Or if you want to get fancy,
IFACEMETHODIMP StandardWidgets::get_TotalCost(INT32* result)
{
    *result = 0;

    RETURN_IF_FAILED(LazyInitializeWidgetList());

    *result = std::transform_reduce(                         
        m_widgets.begin(), m_widgets.end(), 0, std::plus<>(),
        [](auto&& w) { return w->GetCost(); });              
    return S_OK;
}

Okay, but back to the crash. I think I’ve added enough filler to give you time to consider what is happening.
When I looked at this crash, I noticed that the class is implemented with  the Microsoft::WRL::RuntimeClass template class, and the implementation explicitly listed FtmBase as a template parameter, marking this class as free-threaded (also known as “agile”), which means that it can be used from multiple threads simultaneously.¹
The object is eligible for multithreaded use, but there are no mutexes to protect two threads from modifying m_widgets at the same time. I suspected a race condition.
You can also observe that the class is being used in a free-threaded manner because the stack trace that leads to the crash says that it’s running on a thread pool thread (TppWorkerThread), and thread pool threads default to the multi-threaded apartment.² The only code on the stack between TppWorkerThread and the application code is all COM and RPC, so no application code snuck in and initialized the thread into single-threaded apartment mode.
And when I looked at the crash dump, I caught the code red-handed: There was another thread also calling into this code.

Notice that the this pointer is the same for both threads, so we have proof that this object is being used from multiple threads simultaneously.
The fix for the multithreading issue is to ensure that only one thread tries to initialize the widget vector at a time. We can do this by adding a mutex, but I’m going to go even further and use the std::once_flag, whose purpose in life is to be used in conjunction with std::call_once to perform thread-safe one-time initialization, which is exactly what we want.
class StandardWidgets : RuntimeClass<IStandardWidgets, FtmBase>
{
    IFACEMETHODIMP get_TotalCost(INT32* result);
    ⟦ other methods not relevant here ⟧

private:
    HRESULT LazyInitializeWidgetList();

    static constexpr PCWSTR standardWidgetNames[] = {
        L"Bob", L"Carol", L"Ted", L"Alice" };
    static constexpr int standardWidgetCount =
        ARRAYSIZE(standardWidgetNames);

    std::once_flag m_initializeFlag;
    std::vector<ComPtr<Widget>> m_widgets;
};

HRESULT StandardWidgets::LazyInitializeWidgetList()
{
    try {
        std::call_once(m_initializeFlag, [&] {
            std::vector<ComPtr<Widget>> widgets;
            widgets.reserve(standardWidgetCount);
            for (auto name : standardWidgetNames) {
                ComPtr<Widget> widget;
                THROW_IF_FAILED(
                    MakeAndInitialize<Widget>(&widget, name));
                widgets.push_back(widget);
            }
            m_widgets = std::move(widgets);
        });
    } catch (std::bad_alloc const&) {
        return E_OUTOFMEMORY;
    }
    return S_OK;
}

Update: We had to change the RETURN_IF_FAILED to THROW_IF_FAILED because (1) without the change, the compiler will complain that not all code paths return a value, because the lambda also falls off the end, and more importantly, (2) call_once doesn’t care about the lambda return value; it uses exceptions to detect errors. End Update.
This version also deals with the edge case where there are no standard widgets at all. The original code would continuously try to reinitialize the vector since it couldn’t tell whether an empty vector means “Not yet initialized” or “Successfully initialized (and it’s empty)”.
Bonus chatter: How did this multithreaded race condition lead to a vector with a ridiculous size? Well, we saw some time ago that  the internal structure of a std::vector is three pointers, one for the start of the vector data, one for the end of the valid data, and one for the end of the allocated data. If two threads call reserve() simultaneously, both will allocate new data, and then they were race to update the three pointers. You might end up with a “start” pointer that points to the data allocated by the first thread, but an “end” pointer that points to the data allocated by the second thread, resulting in a vector of unusual size.
¹ It was actually convenient that the implementation lists FtmBase explicitly, since the default behavior varies depending on whether __WRL_CONFIGURATION_LEGACY__ is set.

In pseudocode:

The explicitly inclusion of FtmBase saved me the trouble of looking up what mode the customer’s project is using.
