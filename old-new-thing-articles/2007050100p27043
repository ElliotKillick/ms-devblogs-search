         Here are a few citations for the word  operationalize. 
 A lot of work lies ahead to operationalize this plan. 
 Provide security guidance and tools to help operationalize security for enterprise environments. 
 I thought it meant “carry out” or “put into effect”, and then I saw this sentence: 
 Operationalize the demo (get computers configured, install software, verify network access). 
 Now I’m not sure any more.
