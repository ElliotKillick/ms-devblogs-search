        In mathematics, a level set is the set of points at which a function takes a particular value. This has nothing to do with the way the term is used at Microsoft.

 The next is from a presentation to a large group on some investigative work a team undertook. After the presenter spent a few minutes discussing the background of the problem:
 That’s some level-setting on the hardware we had available for investigation. 
 Here are some citations from presentation slide decks:

 Teams share solution overviews, roadmaps and architecture views with each other to level set. 
 (Notice that level-set is as a verb.)
 From what I can gather, level-setting is some sort of blend of expectation-setting and  calibration.
