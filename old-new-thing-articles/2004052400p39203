          Yes the “S” in  NASA  stands for “Space”,  but don’t forget that the “A” stands for “Aeronautics”.  One of the programs that I (amateur aviation wannabe)  find fascinating is the  Aviation Safety  Reporting System, where pilots can submit anonymous  reports of “stupid things I have done” in order to teach  other pilots “Don’t do what I did.”  
    Back issues of their newsletter, Callback, are online.
