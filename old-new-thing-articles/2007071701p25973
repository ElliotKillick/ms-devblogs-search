         Sara Ford  messed up her leg last month; you can see her on  ScooterCam-1 at TechEd 2007. The best part of the name ScooterCam-1 isn’t the ScooterCam; it’s the 1. That just gives it that extra little kitchy space technology feel that turns a good name into a great name.
 Anyway, she asked around if somebody with a car with an automatic transmission would be willing to swap with her manual transmission car until her leg got better. To me, driving a stick shift is like changing a flat tire: It’s something that everybody should know how to do, but it’s not something that anybody is expected to enjoy doing. I offered my car and (long boring part of story deleted) we met at her place and exchanged keys. I got into her car, backed out of the parking space, and… stalled right in front of her.
 Great job there. I really know how to instill confidence.
