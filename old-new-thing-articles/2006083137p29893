         (In the continuing  sporadic series on the wisdom of seventh grade students.) 
 My friend the seventh grade teacher once had to deal with a class that had gotten out of hand by assigning the students a short essay in which they had to address three questions: 

How am I contributing to class? 
How am I detracting from class? 
How can I contribute more while detracting less? 

 One of the more disruptive students answered the questions thus: 

How am I contributing to class?     “I tell jokes.” 
How am I detracting from class?     “Sometimes I talk out of turn.” 
How can I contribute more while detracting less?     “Tell better jokes.”
