        Please post suggestions for future topics in the suggestion box instead of posting off-topic comments. Note that the suggestion box is emptied and read periodically so don’t be surprised if your suggestion vanishes.
And now that there’s a suggestion box, I’m going to prune off-topic comments more aggresively.
