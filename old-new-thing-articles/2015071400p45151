        One of the moments from the Windows 95 ship party (20 years ago today) was when one of the team members drove his motorcycle through the halls, leaving burns in the carpet. 
The funny part of that story (beyond the fact that it happened) is that nobody can agree on who it was! I seem to recall that it was Todd, but another of my colleagues remembers that it was Dave, and yet another remembers that it was Ed. We all remember the carpet burns, but we all blame it on different people. 
As one of my colleagues noted, “I’m glad all of this happened before YouTube.” 
Brad Silverberg, the vice president of the Personal Systems Division (as it was then known), recalled that “I had a lot of apologizing to do to Facilities [about all the shenanigans that took place that day], but it was worth it.”
