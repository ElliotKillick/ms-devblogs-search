         Some years ago, a colleague of mine received a message from our IT department. It began like this: 
 You are receiving this notification because our records show that the machines below are still running a pre-release version of Office 2010. All pre-release versions of Office 2010 will expire on Office 31, 2010. 
 Either the Office team managed to  name a month after themselves, or the IT department had a bit too much Office on their mind.
