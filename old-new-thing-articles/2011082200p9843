        Commenter rolfhub suggested that, to help people recover from  accidentally going into Tiny Footprint Mode, the Task Manager could  display a right-click context menu with an entry to return to normal mode.
 My initial reaction to this was Huh? Who right-clicks on nothing? Tiny Footprint Mode is itself already a bad secret hidden setting. Having the exit from the mode be a right-click menu on a blank space is a double-secret hidden setting.
 If I had  dictatorial control over all aspects of the shell, I would put a Restore button   in the upper right corner to let people return to normal mode.
