        Recall that Microspeak is not merely for jargon exclusive to Microsoft, but also for jargon that you need to know. 
A project will set some goals, which are things it intends to accomplish. It may also set stretch goals, which are things it hopes to accomplish. If you fail to achieve a stretch goal, your project is still a success, but if you make it, your project is even more awesome. A stretch goal could be unrelated to an existing goal. 

Goals for this release 

Support dynamic widget recolorization. 
Stretch goals for this release 

Improve throughput by 10% compared to previous version. 
Non-goals for this release 

Support offline mode. 

But more often, it takes the form of a higher level of achievement for an existing goal: 
Goal: 40% of the programs will land actual spend within 10% of estimate. Stretch goal: 60%. 
Setting a stretch goal is tricky. You want to set it just at the edge of achievability. If you make it unrealistic, then nobody will take it seriously. 
You can think of a stretch goal as an “extra credit” assignment. You won’t be penalized for missing it, but making it will earn you kudos.
