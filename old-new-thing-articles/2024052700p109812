        Some time ago, I displayed in tabular form  the difference between Uuid­To­String String­From­CLSID, String­From­IID, String­From­GUID2. But the entries for String­From­CLSID and String­From­IID are identical. So what’s the difference between those two?
There’s no difference. The two functions are functionally identical.
So why have two functions that do the same thing?
Probably just to provide counterparts to their buddies IID­From­String and CLSID­From­String, which do behave differently, because CLSID­From­String also supports ProgIds.
