          TechNet Magazine‘s  January • February 2006 issue is now available, including  a short article from me on the resourcefulness of people trying to be annoying. The issue also has an article on  how to use the Volume Shadow Copy Service which  I mentioned a few months ago. (And if you had read that posting from last September, you’ll know why the Previous Versions Client is kept in a folder called “twclient”. Try using that at a party to impress someone.)
