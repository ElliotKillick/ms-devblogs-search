         Ballard is the Scandinavian neighborhood in Seattle, and they ordered some stone slabs for a new seating area in Bergen Place Park. What they didn’t expect was that the Swedish stone would read  S∀ERIGE. I mean, yeah, those Swedes do strange things with their A’s, like put dots and circles over them, but I’m pretty sure they don’t turn them upside-down and treat them as V’s.
