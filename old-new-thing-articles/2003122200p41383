        Recent articles on how PowerPoint contributed to failure at NASA reminded me that this is hardly a new discovery. The Department of Defense long ago discovered that PowerPoint is a great way to hide the fact that you don’t know what you’re talking about.
I remember reading an article (which I of course can’t find now) of a “cult of PowerPoint”. Apparently some organizations take the built-in PowerPoint template as gospel. Every presentation must follow the structure established by the PowerPoint template. The first slide is always a title; the second is always a statement of a problem; the third slide is always summary of previous work, etc.
Um, people, it’s just a template.
And before the Linux folks get all so gloaty: “Ravens Coach Brian Billick faults last week’s [October 2001] defensive breakdown on team’s switch to Linux operating system.”
