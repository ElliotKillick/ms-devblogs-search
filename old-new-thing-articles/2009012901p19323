         It is common among my circle of friends to have  Battlestar Galactica-watching parties, and one way of making it a party is by playing games. 
 Things we’ve done (or plan on doing): 

Battlestar Galactica tarot card readings. 
Battlestar Galactica Jeopardy. 
Battlestar Galactica Family Feud     (based on results of actual online polls,     like “Which Battlestar Galactica character would look good in a dress.”) 
Battlestar Galactica Apples to Apples. 
Battlestar Galactica     Password. 
Battlestar Galactica cocktails.
