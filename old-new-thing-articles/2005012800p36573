Sometimes people go to great lengths to get information which
is available in a much simpler way.
We saw it a few days ago when we found a 200+-line C# program that
could be replaced with

a 90-byte batch file.
Here’s another example

of a rather roundabout way of
capturing the current directory from a batch file.


The easy way is to use the %CD% pseudo-variable.
It expands to the current working directory.


set OLDDIR=%CD%
.. do stuff ..
chdir /d %OLDDIR% &rem restore current directory


(Of course, directory save/restore could more easily have been
done with pushd/popd, but that’s not the point here.)


The %CD% trick is handy even from the command line.
For example, I often find myself in a directory where there’s
a file that I want to operate on but… oh, I need to
chdir to some other directory in order to perform that operation.


set _=%CD%\curfile.txt
cd ... some other directory ...
somecommand args %_% args


(I like to use %_% as my scratch environment variable.)


Type SET /? to see the other pseudo-variables provided by the
command processor.
