        My older niece visited me at work one day, and I got her a carton of chocolate milk, which she very much enjoyed. Some days later, she told me, “I want to go to your work.”
 “Why?” I asked.
 “I want to take all your chocolate milk.”
 Missing from the story is that upon returning home after that first visit, she told everybody about her awesome visit with her uncle, and that he even got her a chocolate milk from the refrigerator. “And the chocolate milk is free, you can just take it!”
 Her uncle (not me, a different uncle) told her, “Then you should go there with a knapsack and take all the chocolate milk.”
 That uncle is clearly a troublemaker. I’ll have to keep an eye on him.
