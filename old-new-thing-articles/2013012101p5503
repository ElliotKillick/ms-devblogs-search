For

many

years,
I’ve put together a

little pocket guide

to the Seattle Symphony

subscription

season
for my symphony friends to help them decide which
ticket package they want.
In the years that have passed since I started doing this,
nearly all of the members of the group have started families,
and we tried things like splitting tickets,
but even that became difficult to maintain,
and last year, we ended up not ordering any tickets at all.
(Well, no tickets for adults.
We did buy tickets to

kids concerts.)


I compiled the
at-a-glance season guide for the 2013/2014 season anyway,
but I didn’t bother adding my comments since we know we’re
not ordering any tickets.
Moreover, the Seattle Symphony created online playlists
where you can listen to the pieces in the upcoming season,
so you can decide for yourself whether you like them or not!


Here is

the official brochure for those who want to read the details,
and you can see

what The Seattle Times thinks of it.
To access the playlists, go to

www.naxos­music­library.com
and log on with userid SymphonySubs with password
20132014.
Once you’ve logged in, click Playlists in the navigation bar
and choose the concerts you want to hear.

function filter(c)
{
 var rows = document.getElementById(“schedule”).getElementsByTagName(“TR”);
 for (var i = 0; i != rows.length; i++) {
  var row = rows[i];
  var className = row.className;
  if (className != “”) {
   if (c == ‘all’ || className.indexOf(c) >= 0) {
    row.style.display = “”;
   } else {
    row.style.display = “none”;
   }
  }
 }
}

For those not familiar with the Seattle Symphony ticket package line-ups:
Most of the ticket packages are named Masterworks nX where
n is
the number is the number of concerts in the package, and the letter
indicates which variation.
Ticket packages have been combined if they are
identical save for the day of the week.
For example, 7C and 7D are the same concerts;
the only difference is that 7C is for Thursday nights, while 7D is
for Saturday nights.


The WolfGang series is available only to members of the

WolfGang club.
It also includes two concerts not listed above (Opening Night
and Sonic Evolution).


This chart doesn’t include “one-off” concert series such
as the Mainly Mozart or Distinguished Artists series.
A “one-off” series is a concert series which shares no concerts
with any other series.
This year, the

Beyond the Score
multimedia concerts fell into that category.


According to the Seattle Times article,
the new music director has
“always dreamed of spending a whole evening with a composer,”
and he went big this year, with
three concerts consist of multiple works by a single composer.


Symphony trivia:
The audience for the
Sunday afternoon concerts (series 7G) leans toward
what we in the United States euphemistically call
senior citizens.
I find it interesting to see what those sweet old ladies
get put through every year.
For example, this year, they get a performance of
Carmina burana,
which will probably offend half of the audience and
delight the other half.
