        Dona Sarkar is an aspiring fashion designer, a fashion blogger, a book author, and head of the Windows Insiders program. 
She’s also way cooler than I will ever be. Here’s her proposed title slide for one of her presentations at the Build 2018 conference.¹

Maybe if I hang out with her enough, some of the cool will rub off. 
On the other hand, in Mary Jo Foley’s preview coverage of Build 2018, she called out four speakers: The three keynote speakers, and me. 
So like no pressure or anything. 
The event organizers instructed the speakers to upload a photo and brief biography, with the note: “Your biography should be 150 words or less (including spaces).” 
“Including spaces”? What does that even mean? 
I didn’t count the spaces. They appeared to accept the biography anyway. 
¹ Thankfully no longer styled as //build/, though the three slashes are still present in the conference logo design.
