        An overflow crowd attended The Seattle Improbable Show. It was, as expected, a rollicking good time.
 Mark Abrahams emceed and gave presentations, one on  each of last year’s Ig Nobel Prize winners, another chronicling various stages in the development of Project Grizzly. Other speakers were allotted five minutes (strictly and amusingly enforced) to expound on their chosen subjects, my favorite of which was Yoram Bauman‘s thought-provoking  Translation of Mankiw’s Ten Principles of Economics. (Don’t miss footnote 3!)
 Note to self: Next time, bring more paper. (For making and throwing paper airplanes, of course.) I brought only two this time. Need more.
