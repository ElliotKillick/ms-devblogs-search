Although the

x64 calling convention
reserves space on the stack as spill locations
for the first four parameters (passed in registers),
there is no requirement that the spill locations actually be used
for spilling.
They’re just 32 bytes of memory available for scratch use by the function
being called.



We have a test program that works okay when optimizations are disabled,
but when compiled with full optimizations, everything appears to be wrong
right off the bat.
It doesn’t get the correct values for
argc and argv:


int __cdecl
wmain( int argc, WCHAR** argv ) { ... }


With optimizations disabled, the code is generated correctly:


        mov         [rsp+10h],rdx  // argv
        mov         [rsp+8],ecx    // argc
        sub         rsp,158h       // local variables
        mov         [rsp+130h],0FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEh
        ...


But when we compile with optimizations, everything is completely
messed up:


        mov         rax,rsp
        push        rsi
        push        rdi
        push        r13
        sub         rsp,0E0h
        mov         qword ptr [rsp+78h],0FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEh
        mov         [rax+8],rbx    // ??? should be ecx (argc)
        mov         [rax+10h],rbp  // ??? should be edx (argv)



When compiler optimizations are disabled, the Visual C++ x64 compiler
will spill all register parameters into their corresponding slots.
This has as a nice side effect that debugging is a little easier,
but really it’s just because you disabled optimizations,
so the compiler generates simple, straightforward code,
making no attempts to be clever.


When optimizations are enabled, then the compiler becomes more
aggressive about removing redundant operations and using memory
for multiple purposes when variable lifetimes don’t overlap.
If it finds that it doesn’t need to save argc
into memory (maybe it puts it into a register),
then the spill slot for argc can be used for
something else; in this case, it’s being used to preserve
the value of rbx.


You see the same thing even in x86 code,
where the memory used to pass parameters can be re-used
for other purposes once the value of the parameter is no
longer needed in memory.
(The compiler might load the value into a register and use
the value from the register for the remainder of the function,
at which point the memory used to hold the parameter becomes
unused and can be redeployed for some other purpose.)


Whatever problem you’re having with your test program,
there is nothing obviously wrong with the code generation
provided in the purported defect report.
The problem lies elsewhere.
(And it’s probably somewhere in your program.

Don’t immediately assume that the reason for your problem
is a compiler bug.)


Bonus chatter:
In a (sadly rare) follow-up, the customer confessed that the
problem was indeed in their program.
They put a function call inside an assert,
and in the nondebug build, they disabled assertions
(by passing /DNDEBUG to the compiler),
which means that in the nondebug build, the function was never called.

Challenges of debugging optimized x64 code.
That .frame /r command is real time-saver.
