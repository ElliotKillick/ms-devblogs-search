         A college classmate of mine informed me that one of his colleagues had planned his wedding so far in advance that on his negative-first anniversary (i.e., precisely one year before his anticipated wedding date), he gave  paper to all of his friends. 
 Said my classmate, “It’s too bad that neither of us had been born on his −50th anniversary. That would have been more lucrative.”
