         Portsmouth’s  ever-delayed Millennium Tower (since renamed  Spinnaker Tower) has  finally been completed, five years late and £11 million over budget. But even opening day couldn’t escape without its own glitches, for  the project manager was trapped in a glass-walled lift for over an hour, requiring  abseiling engineers to come and rescue him.
