         The jargon phrase going forward has largely replaced the more mundane equivalent from now on. It appears that  Iâ€™m not the only person who is bothered by this phrase. Sample usages: 

We discussed the membership and timeframe for support team meetings     going forward. 
There will be change to the status reports going forward. 
Going forward we will be doing this for every milestone. 

 Notice that the phrase going forward usually adds little to the sentence. You can delete it from all of the sentences above and nobody would notice a difference.
