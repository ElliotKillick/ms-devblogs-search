        A customer wanted to know what error code their shell extension should return from the IFolderView::Items method if their folder has no items.
This was a trick question, because you shouldn’t return an error at all!
Returning an error means, “I was unable to retrieve the list of items. Something terrible happened!” This generally leads to a cascade of failures, and Explorer gives up on your shell extension.
If you want to say “I have no items,” then return S_OK and an empty collection. If the requested interface is IEnumIDList, then return an enumerator that enumerates on objects. If the requested interface is IShellItemArray, then return a zero-sized array.
The point is that you want to say “I was able to get the items. And here they are!” (And you give them an empty collection.)
This is a general principle for all collection-returning functions: If you want to return an empty collection, then return an empty collection.¹ Don’t return an error.
Embrace the power of the empty set.
By analogy, suppose you had a method
class WidgetContainer
{
public:
    std::vector<Widget> GetActiveWidgets();
};

If there are no active Widgets in the WidgetContainer, you shouldn’t throw an exception. You should just return an empty std::vector.
¹ In this case, the customer also tried returning S_OK and a null pointer from the IFolderView::Items method. This caused Explorer to crash on a null pointer, because Explorer asked for the items, and you said, “Sure, here they are!” and gave a null pointer.
There are some methods, such as IShellFolder::EnumObjects, which carve out a special case that permits you to return S_FALSE and a null pointer as the result. But these are special cases that apply only if the method explicitly permits it. And even then, they don’t allow you return a failure; returning a failure means that you were unable to get the items at all.
