        In February 2007, a serious automobile accident took place in southwest Washington.  A twelve-year-old boy was at the wheel of an SUV when he lost control and struck another vehicle. According to the sheriff’s office, “Excessive speed appeared to be a factor in the crash.” I dunno, I think a major factor is that a twelve-year-old was behind the wheel.
 Tragically, the boy sustained critical injuries and died the following day. There was an adult in the car who conveniently  doesn’t remember what happened, although there are rumors that  this wasn’t the first time that adult let the boy drive, and that the boy had remarked to a friend that “he always drove to school.” Okay, what adult lets a twelve year old boy drive a car? Apparently, he was permitted to drive because he asked to. 
  News flash: There are times when the correct answer is “No”. 
 Follow-up: Court documents cite witnesses who claim “the boy had driven several times, at speeds up to 80 miles an hour.” It was noted in passing in May 2007 that  the adult pled not guilty to vehicular manslaughter charges. 
 Conclusion: As part of a plea agreement,  the adult was sentenced to five years in prison plus probation.
