         There are a variety of ways of  finding out when your patent is granted, but the quickest mechanism is to check your mailbox. But the thing to look for is not what you might think. 
 Even before you receive word from your companyâ€™s patent department,  you will start receiving junk mail delivered to your home address from companies that sell patent-related novelties, pointless trinkets like pencils and mugs with your patent number on it. Nevermind that you can probably order personalized pencils for much less than what the patent-chasers were offering.
