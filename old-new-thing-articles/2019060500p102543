        So your  C++/WinRT project gets build failures of the form
base.h(8208): error C2259: 'winrt::impl::produce<D, I>': cannot instantiate abstract class
with
[
    D=winrt::YourNamespace::implementation::YourClass,
    I=winrt::Windows::UI::Xaml::Markup::IComponentConnector2
] (compiling source file YourClass.cpp)
base.h(8208): note: due to following members: (compiling source file YourClass.cpp)
base.h(8208): note: 'int32_t winrt::impl::abi<winrt::Windows::UI::Xaml::Markup::IComponentConnector2, void>::type::GetBindingConnector(int32_t, void *, void **) noexcept': is abstract (compiling source file YourClass.cpp)

Normally, the Get­Binding­Connector function is defined in YourClass.xaml.g.hpp, but that header file isn’t being generated.
What’s going on, and how do you fix it?
The problem is that you forgot to include the header file
#include "winrt/Windows.UI.Xaml.Markup.h"

Add that line to, say, your precompiled header file, and things should work again.
You are likely to run into this problem when upgrading a project from C++/WinRT 1.0 to C++/WinRT 2.0. The C++/WinRT 2.0 compiler is much better about reducing header file dependencies, which improves build times. If you forgot to include winrt/Windows.UI.Xaml.Markup.h in a C++/WinRT 1.0 project, you often got away with it, because some other C++/WinRT 1.0 header file you included happened to include winrt/Windows.UI.Xaml.Markup.h as a side effect. You were getting a free ride on the other header file.
