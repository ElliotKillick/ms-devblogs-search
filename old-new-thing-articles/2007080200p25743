         When you’re installing your shell extension, you need to know which progid to hang it off of inside HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT. We’ll start with the title question and then move on to other predefined (but perhaps not well-known) progids. 

“Folder” is the progid for any shell folder.     It could be a virtual folder (like Control Panel)     or a file system folder (like C:\WINDOWS). 
“Directory” is the progid for file system folders.     This is a subset of “Folder”. 
“*” is the progid for all files.     Doesn’t matter what the extension is. 
“.” (that’s a single period) is the progid for files without any extension. 
“AllFileSystemObjects” is the union of “*” and “Directory”.     It is the progid for all files and for file system directories.
