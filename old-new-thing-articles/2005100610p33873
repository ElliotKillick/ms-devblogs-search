         My colleague  Jensen Harris from the Office User Interface team has joined the 7am club, posting fascinating glimpes into  Office history and the upcoming version of Office code-named “Office 12“. And they come out at 7am every weekday. 
 Then again,  maybe he’s not real either. Maybe he’s  some kind of a robot.
