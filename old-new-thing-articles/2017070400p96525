        When you have a city, you also need infrastructure, but the buildings for that infrastructure tend to be ugly, so you now have the need to camouflage your infrastructure as something inoffensive. And not just utilities need camouflage. An oil company might need to disguise a well. 


    Near Raleigh, a water pump station is         disguised as a single-family home. 

    A house in London is just         a façade to disguise a ventilation shaft for     the underground line. 

    The same for         a house in Paris. 

    In Brooklyn, a house is         a ventilation shaft and emergency exit. 

    Many houses in the Toronto area         are electrical substations.     More pictures. 

    You can disguise an oil well         as a synagogue.     (Search for “the bus arrives at the Genessee well site”.)         Another page. 

    Or you can disguise your oil wells as         luxury hotels. 

    Or         an office building (photo 18),     or a who-knows-what (photos 16 and 17). 

    You don’t even need to blend in.     You can disguise your electrical substation as something         dramatic and imposing yet ambiguous. 

    A tunnel ventilation shaft that is         dramatically imposing yet ambiguous.         Another. 

    There is an entire industry devoted to disguising     cell phone towers.     Some companies rent space in church steeples or any other tall structure.     Or you can         construct a fake tree,     a         fake water tower,     or any number of other fake things. 

    But people are so used to seeing cell phone towers that there is     a secondary industry of         disguising other things as cell phone towers. 

    A military radar station         disguised as farm buildings.     Yes, this doesn’t fit the pattern of urban camouflage,     but it’s still cool.
