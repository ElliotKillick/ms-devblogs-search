         The Washington State Association of County Auditors have  a web site explaining steps people need to take to ensure their vote is counted properly. Unfortunately, the auditors didn’t review what the web design team came up with, because their page on  how to mark your ballot is illustrated with a cute graphic with a check-mark. Too bad the check mark is the wrong way to cast your vote in every single county in Washington. For written ballots, you’re supposed to fill in the square or circle completely, not use a check-mark. 
 You’d think after all these years I’d eventually get this voting thing down. Most years, I make a wrong turn looking for my polling place. This year, I focused and managed to get there without any mistakes, only to find that I forgot to bring my voting registration card. (Actually, I usually forget my card most years. I’ve gotten pretty good at looking up my name in the book.)
