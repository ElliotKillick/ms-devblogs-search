        I had finished some store-bought soup and thought to myself, “That was a pretty good soup. What brand was it? I’ll buy it again.”
 I went to my recycle bin to fish out the aseptic box that the soup came in, and looked for the brand name. And I found it:  dnos. 
 I thought to myself, “That’s a strange name for a soup company.”
