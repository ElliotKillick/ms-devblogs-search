Bryan Gaw had been a member of Katy Perry’s dance team for five years     when he performed at the 2015 Super Bowl,     a dancer’s dream come true.     During the show, he changed out of a metallic horse costume into     a shark costume.         He became Left Shark. 
euclidea.xyz     is an online game where you try to solve     ruler-and-compass problems.     It’s as gripping as it sounds. 
Tom Wildenhain does it again.         WordTeX – A WYSIPCTWOTCG Typesetting Tool.     (Previously.) 
I’ve         written about Music for 18 Musicians before.     I found this curiosity in one performance:         During this section, the woman in the blue jacket     plays the marimba from the wrong side     because there aren’t enough marimbas,     so three musicians must share one instrument.     I asked one of my percussionist friends how hard this is.     “Like anything else, you get better with practice.     But (and I think this is what you’re after)     it’s not something you are normally taught,     any more than pianists are normally taught how to         play the piano from the wrong side.” 
        Love & breadsticks: There was a knife fight at Olive Garden.     Joe Wadlington     went on a date with the former general manager of the Olive Garden     in Times Square.     It became an interview. 
    A lecture by         Irving Younger     on his         10 Commandments Of Cross Examination.     I’m not a lawyer, but I found it fascinating. 
        Surgical resident Annie Onishi evaluates     emergency rooms and operating rooms in movies and television. 
        Doctors diagnose the injuries in Home Alone.     ER physician Seth Brenner is my favorite. He really gets into it. 
    The crazy people at     Danish radio-controlled vehicle company     morfars.dk     created a         GDPR-compliant shredder.     “The faster you shred, the more compliant you are.”     Video is in Danish, but with English subtitles.     (Unsubtitled         short version.) 
    At the 1:00 mark in the previous video, the subtitles say     “Mumbles: This is insane.”     I found this subtitle     hilarious because normal Danish already sounds like     mumbling.         Not even Danes can understand each other. 
Your     King County (Washington, USA) library card will get you free museum passes. 
        Why nobody ever wins the mall car giveaway. 
        Another history of Space Cadet Pinball. 
Why does Windows     think my wireless keyboard is a toaster? 
        The top ten worst repositories to host on GitHub.     At least CocoaPods has         taken measures to try to be less worst. 
    Terrible Ideas in Git,     a presentation by     Corey Quinn. 
        Status bar == almost entire superfluous. 
        The Japanese Calendar’s Y2K Moment:     my colleague     Shawn Steele     writes about         the planned abdication of the Japanese Emperor     and its effect upon the Japanese calendar.     To help developers identify issues related to the first change of     Emperor most software will ever experience,     Windows 10 added a placeholder for the upcoming Era,     so you can test your applications before it’s too late.     Read more about it in Shawn’s article. 
        The Stack Clash vulnerability and the Ancient Pharaohs.     Application compatibility is hard.     Note footnote 1 that this particular game also assumes that     the high bit of pointers is always zero.     Footnote 3 is also interesting. 
        The Great Bug Hunt.     Allen Pike also discusses         The Canadian Cheese Cartel with panache.     I covered part of this story when I discussed         tariff engineering, but Allen’s version is much more entertaining.     I also hope he’s okay with me calling him Allen     instead of Mr. Pike or something like that. 

And a list of my recent new One Dev Question videos. 

        What was the Bedlam incident?     (Higher     resolution video.)     Here is the promised         technical breakdown of the Bedlam incident     courtesy of Larry Osterman. 
        Why was Documents and Settings renamed to Users?     (Higher     resolution video.) 

The One Dev Minute folks managed to con Larry Osterman into recording some short videos for them. (Second video.) So if you’re sick of me, you can go check those out.
