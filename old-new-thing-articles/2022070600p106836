        As I noted  some time ago, the empty Windows Runtime string is represented by a null pointer. This has natural but perhaps surprising consequences: Even though it is a null pointer, the empty Windows Runtime string is a real string, with hopes and dreams. Or at least a length and data.
At the ABI level, Windows­Get­String­Len reports that a null pointer string has a length of zero, and Windows­Get­String­Raw­Buffer gives you a buffer that consists of a single null terminator.
Since an empty string and a null pointer are indistinguishable at the ABI layer, if you operate at the ABI layer (using raw HSTRINGs) or at a thin projection layer (such as C++/CX and C++/WinRT), you can take advantage of this equivalence.
For starters, you don’t need to check for a null pointer before trying to use the string, because a null pointer is a perfectly valid HSTRING.



ABI
if (s != nullptr &&
    WindowsGetStringLen(s) == 1)
if (s != nullptr &&
    s == HStringReference(L"hi").Get())


C++/CX
if (s != nullptr &&
    s->Length() == 1)
if (s != nullptr &&
    s == L"hi")


C++/WinRT
if (s != hstring{} &&
    s.size() == 1)
if (s != hstring{} &&
    s == L"hi"sv)



If you are checking for a nonempty string, you can just check for null. C++/WinRT and C++/CX even have special methods that tell you directly.



 
Slower way
Quicker way


ABI
if (WindowsGetStringLen(s) != 0)
if (s != nullptr)


C++/CX
if (s->Length() != 0)
if (!s->IsEmpty())


C++/WinRT
if (s.size() != 0)
if (!s.empty())



Related:  The C++/CX String^ is not an object, even though it wears a hat.
