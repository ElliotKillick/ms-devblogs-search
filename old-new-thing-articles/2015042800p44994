        We saw  some time ago that permission to delete a file is granted either

if you have DELETE access on the file, or 
if you have FILE_DELETE_CHILD     access on the containing directory. 

 File attributes behave in an analogous way.
 Permission to read a file’s attributes is granted either

if you have FILE_READ_ATTRIBUTES access on the file,     or 
if you have FILE_LIST_DIRECTORY     access on the containing directory. 

 If you want the file’s attributes, you could always get it by reading the directory, because one of the pieces of information you get from Find­First­File is the file attributes. Therefore, having permission to read a directory implicitly gives you permission to read the attributes of any file in that directory.
 (Note, of course, that write permission on attributes is another story.)
