         I dreamed that Costco announced that they were closing for the  Mayan apocalypse and would reopen two weeks later. Not because they believed in it. Rather, because that was their estimate as to how long it would take people to get through their stockpiles and be ready to go shopping again. 
 Curiously, I had this dream several weeks after the apocalypse date had passed.
