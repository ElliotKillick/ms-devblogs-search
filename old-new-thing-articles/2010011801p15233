        I received a brochure in the mail for a local church which says that it’s “full of people just like you.”
 Everybody in the brochure is white.
 “You’ll fit right in!” it concludes.
 Bonus chatter: My friends guessed that perhaps the church members are all computer programmers who work at Microsoft and speak Swedish badly.
