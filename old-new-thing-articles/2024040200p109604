         Microsoft Employees Are Hooked on the Company’s Training Videos (WSJ paywall). But really, what I want to call attention to is the video that plays even if you don’t have a subscription: I can tell that the scene was filmed on the fourth floor of Building 41.
Each of the six floors of Building 41 is themed after a stage in the development of computing.
First floor: Abacus (ca. 2700 BCE).

Second floor: Jacquard loom card (1804).

Third floor: Hollerith punch card (1890).

Fourth floor: Circuit board (1960).

Fifth floor: Social media and hashtags (2009).

Sixth floor: Cloud computing racks (2018).
