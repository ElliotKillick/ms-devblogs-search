        I was watching an internal training video on proper handling of expense reports. The narrator says, “This is a small expense report, and everything looks good.” 
But everything does not look good. The expense report says Meals: USD $14, but the receipt is for a $153 flat-screen monitor. 
Was this a test? I’m not sure.
