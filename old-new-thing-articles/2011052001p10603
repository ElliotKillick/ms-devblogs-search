        In a discussion of commuting options (in which I was primarily an observer), the following exchange took place:
 A: I would rather get kicked in the shins every morning than bike up the  massive hill that sits between my apartment and main campus.
 B: Have you tried an electric bike?
 C: If you’re going to eliminate pedaling, then you may as well go all the way and get a Segway.
 B: Actually, I used to own a Segway. I was floored by the engineering achievement of creating a device that combined the speed benefits of walking with the exercise benefits of driving, and for just the cost of a used Honda!
 Note, of course, that this is just one engineer’s opinion. Some people at Microsoft are  quite enamored of the Segway device.
 Public Service Announcement: Today is Bike to Work Day. A number of  commute stations will be set up along popular bike routes in the greater Seattle area to hand out bicycling information and snacks. And if you pass a guy creeping up the 520 hill at around 8:00am, that was probably me. Sorry I forgot to wave.
