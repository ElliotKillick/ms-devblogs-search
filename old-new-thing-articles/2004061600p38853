        If you want to re-check that the files on your system  haven’t been tampered with, you can run    sigverif  (by typing its name into the Start.Run dialog)  and tell it to start scanning.
  (UI note: If you go into the Logging page on the Advanced dialog,  you can get trapped where it insists on having a valid  log file name even if you didn’t ask for logging!)
  The signature verification process takes a while, so go and  do something else while you’re waiting. When it’s done, you’ll  get a list of all the system files that are not digitally  signed by Microsoft.  Just because a file is listed here  doesn’t mean that it’s necessarily bad, however.  For example, it might be a video driver or printer driver.
  (Another UI note: You can’t right-click the items in the list  to view their properties, say, to see what company issued the files.)
  One case when you would want to run sigverif is after you remove    the test root certificate  which was causing your desktop to say “for test/evaluation purposes  only”.  That way you can find all the uncertified drivers that snuck in  under cover of the test signature.
