        Commenter Bernard remarked that  he moved from one side of the company campus to the other, and his commute distance (and time) was cut in half.
 That reminds me of a short story from a now-retired colleague of mine. He bicycled to work, and over the years, the gradual expansion of the Microsoft main corporate campus resulted in nearly three quarters of his commute to work taking place on Microsoft property. This bothered him to the point where he changed his route just so he wouldn’t be “at work” practically the moment he left his house.
 Bonus chatter: Looks like  Michael Kaplan also has one of these unbalanced commutes.
