        Okay, so first there was the story about  the planned DHS television series. And then there was the follow-up reporting that  the whole thing was an investment scam and there was no such show after all. Following through on the story, it looks like the ringleader behind the scam has been  sentenced to one year in prison and an accomplice to five years probation and $250 a month in restitution. The TV Squad article says retribution, which would be strange if true.  But it’s not. (Read the announcements of the accomplice’s  indictment and  guilty plea.) At $250 a month, it’s going to take a long time to repay the court-ordered $3.4 million in restitution.
 Two years later, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the judge who imposed the one-year sentence for the ringleader  failed to follow sentencing guidelines (which call for a minimum of 57 months), and ordered that he be sentenced again. 
 Meanwhile, the accomplice appears to have violated the terms of her probation, so she was  sentenced to ten days in jail. 
 Who knows what’ll happen next? This story may never reach its final chapter.
