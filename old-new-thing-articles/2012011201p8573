        As I noted before,  many grocery stores in the United States have a printer next to the cash register which prints out coupons customized to your purchases. Here’s a purchase and the accompanying coupon. What is the story behind this pairing?
 Purchased: Diapers for newborn baby. Coupon: Save 75 cents on ice cream.
 Bonus chatter: While waiting in line, I read the warning label on the diapers. It went on for quite a bit, but one part triggered my “I wonder what lawsuit led to this warning” sensor: “Like most articles of clothing, XYZ brand diapers will burn if exposed to flame.” Did somebody say, “Oh no, there’s a fire, what will I do? I know, I’ll smother the fire with my baby’s diapered bottom!”
