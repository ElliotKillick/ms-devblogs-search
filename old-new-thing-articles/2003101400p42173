         If such a notification were generated, ill-behaved programs would just react to a         click on the balloon’s “X” button with an annoying follow-up dialog like, “Are you         sure you want to ignore my wonderful message?” So there was a conscious decision not         to give them the chance.      
         In the Before Time, software was trusted not to be actively evil, not to second-guess         a user’s action, not to invade a user’s private space.      
     Over the years, we’ve learned that this was a naïve position to take. So now, when     we decide that something is an end-user setting, we actively avoid giving programmatic     access to it, so programs won’t be tempted to weasel themselves into it.
