Some time ago I had a problem with icon drawing.
When I tried to draw an icon with Draw­Icon
it ended up being drawn at the wrong size.
A call to
Get­Icon­Info confirmed that the icon was
48×48, but it drew at 32×32.


The answer is documented in a backwards sort of way
in the Draw­Icon­Ex function, which says at the bottom,



To duplicate DrawIcon (hDC, X, Y, hIcon), call DrawIconEx as follows:


DrawIconEx (hDC, X, Y, hIcon, 0, 0, 0, NULL,
            DI_NORMAL | DI_COMPAT | DI_DEFAULTSIZE);



Aha, if you use Draw­Icon, then the icon size is ignored
and it is drawn with DI_DEFAULT­SIZE.


The fix, therefore, was to switch to the Draw­Icon­Ex
function so I could remove the DI_DEFAULT­SIZE flag,
thereby permitting the icon to be drawn at its actual size.


- DrawIcon(hdc, pt.x, pt.y, hico);
+ DrawIconEx(hdc, pt.x, pt.y, hico, 0, 0, 0, NULL, DI_NORMAL | DI_COMPAT);


A bonus quirk of the
DI_DEFAULT­SIZE flag
(and therefore of the
Draw­Icon function)
is that the drawing is done at the default icon size,
even if you asked it to draw a cursor.
