        The plight of the legally dead (but physically alive) in India  has been taken up by – of course – a legally dead man.  And now    he’s running for public office.  Though apparently    this isn’t the first time.
  (People are usually declared dead by conniving relatives  who want to claim their inheritance prematurely.)
  I wish him luck.  If    it works in Missouri  it can work in India.
