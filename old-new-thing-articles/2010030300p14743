        Microsoft’s telephone department takes security very seriously. Your voicemail password must be at least eight digits long.
 By comparison, the password for my ATM card is only four digits long.
 Because voicemail is that important, I guess.
 (Yes, I know about two-factor authentication. I’m writing this only half-jokingly.)
