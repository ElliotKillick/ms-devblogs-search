         Who knew that  in-flight safety videos could be so popular?  Introduced to the world on  the Delta blog,  the latest Delta in-flight safety video has generated quite a buzz around the Internet. Well, more accurately, the buzz surrounds the video’s star, flight attendant Katherine Lee,  known to her drooling fans as Deltalina, with secondary attention paid to the cameo appearance of Exit Row Girl.  The FlyerTalk forum is all over this topic of grave national importance, including appearances from  Headphone Guy,  Seat Belt Guy, and the aforementioned  Exit Row Girl. 
 I’m not sure who is in more need of a life, the person who can explain  why the volume in the current video jumps up at about the halfway point, or me, the person who actually read the thread to find all these links.
