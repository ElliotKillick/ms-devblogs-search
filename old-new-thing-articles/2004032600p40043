        Here’s    Yahoo’s privacy policy regarding so-called web bugs  (or as they call them “web beacons”) – these are the little 1×1  images that web sites use to keep track of where you’re going.
  Halfway down the page (at least as of the time I wrote this,  which is not the same as the time this gets posted since I write  stuff in advance…) in the section “Outside the Yahoo! Network”  there is a link to opt out of sharing the information with companies  outside the Yahoo! Network.
  Maybe it’s time to start surfing with images off again, or perhaps  somebody can write a plug-in that blocks all 1×1 images.
