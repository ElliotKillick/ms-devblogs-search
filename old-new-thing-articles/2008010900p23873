         The Swedes haven’t quite figured out that my blog entries  do not constitute the official position of Microsoft Corporation. I like how they don’t even mention my name anywhere. They just say “Microsoft doesn’t this” and “Microsoft doesn’t that”. If you go back to the article they used as a source, you’ll see that I provided a variety of reasons for not going into the Start menu point system, but this author decided to claim that reason 1 was not only the only reason but in fact the official reason. 
 Perhaps I should have used a CGI script which randomized the order of the items each time you refreshed.
