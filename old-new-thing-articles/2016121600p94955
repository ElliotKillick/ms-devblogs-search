        I’ve written about my colleague Danny before. He’s an accomplished skier, and one of the things he maintained was a tradition of going skiing at least once every month. He jokingly claimed that he held the unofficial record for consecutive months of skiing. A recent profile in the Seattle Times points out that this is a tradition he has been continuing for 23 years. 
As the article notes, Danny thought he was the only person with such an unusual streak, until he discovered an entire community of like-minded skiers. 
As the article notes, whether he holds the unofficial record for consecutive months of skiing is not really the point, because every skier sets their own criterion for what counts as a “day of skiing”. 
As far as I’m concerned, he holds the record. Not that it really matters.
