        Apparently, when translating their Pokémon game from Japanese to English,  Nintendo changed a question in an in-game personality test that asked you what you would do if you farted. In the English-language version, you merely broke a rotten egg. What, do they think kids in the U.S. don’t fart? Or that they don’t enjoy fart jokes. Allow me to clear up any confusion: Kids in the United States love fart jokes.
 Or maybe British kids don’t fart. Perhaps that’s it.
 (For those who don’t get the subject, it’s a  snowclone of the form  No X please, we’re Y. Learn more  here.)
