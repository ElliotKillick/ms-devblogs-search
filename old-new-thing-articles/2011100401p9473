         In my  2011 mid-year link clearance, I linked to the story  And that’s why you should learn to pick your battles.

Beyoncé, the giant metal chicken  has a Facebook page, populated with all sorts of crazy things like pictures of Beyoncé’s relatives spotted in the wild (some of them knocking on doors or peeking in windows), a No Soliciting sign just for giant metal chickens, and an updated version of the chart of anniversary gifts  which lists BIG METAL CHICKEN as the modern 15th anniversary present.
