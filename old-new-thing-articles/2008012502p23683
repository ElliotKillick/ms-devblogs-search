          Competing with the Miss America pageant for your Saturday evening attention is  the Seattle performance of  PLAY! A Video Game Symphony, featuring music from  a large number of video games. Presumably, the music will have something to do with the accompanying video being projected on large screens. 
 The description of the concert omits any mention of whether this is a cosplay event. Just saying.
