        In the Windows debugging engine,  the sx command configures many of the conditions under which the debugger will break. To enable a break condition, you say sxecond, and the corresponding sxd to disable it. For example, a common command is to ask for the debugger to break when a specific DLL is loaded by saying sxeld contoso.dll.
To break when a specific string is printed to the debugger, you can say sxe out:str. For example, sxe out:*assertion failure* will break whenever any message contains the phrase “assertion failure”.  Here’s the wildcard syntax.
