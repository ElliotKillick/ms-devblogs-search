         Several months ago,  The Seattle Times ran a story on  people who smoke and also work out. In the article, personal trainer Will Baldyga compares it to other dissonant behavior such as pigging out on ice cream after a workout. I have to admit that on rare occasions, I lapse into such behavior (“justifying” bad eating habits with exercise), but on the whole, I manage to keep myself honest.
