          Hotel maids began losing weight once they were informed that their normal job activities counted as exercise. I can’t want for somebody to test whether this placebo effect works in reverse; that is, whether you will lose weight if you aren’t actually exercising but believe that you are. If it works, then sign me up! (Oh rats, they addressed this in the interview.)
