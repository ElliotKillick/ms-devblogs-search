        As a thank-you for  presenting at TechReady11, the conference organizers gave me (and presumably the other speakers) a portable speaker with the Windows logo printed on it.
 The speaker underneath the logo is the  X-Mini II Capsule Speaker, and I have to  agree with Steve Clayton that they pack a lot of sound in a compact size. Great for taking on trips, or even picnics.
 It’s been a long time since I  last recommended a Christmas gift for geeks, so maybe I’ll make up for it by giving two suggestions this year.
 The second suggestion is a response to a comment from that old article: My bicycle lock is just a laptop combination lock that I repurposed as a bicycle lock. It’s a pretty clumsy design for a laptop lock, since  it comes in two parts, one of which is easy to lose, but if you just “accidentally” lose the clip part, what’s left is a simple cable combination lock that easily tucks into a side pocket of my bicycle trunk bag. Yes, that lock isn’t going to stop a dedicated thief for very long, but fortunately, the Microsoft parking garage is not crawling with dedicated thieves because, as a rule,  Microsoft tries not to hire dishonest people.
 So, um, that’s a suggestion for a bicycle lock for somebody who lives in a low-crime area. Hm, maybe that’s not a very good suggestion after all.
