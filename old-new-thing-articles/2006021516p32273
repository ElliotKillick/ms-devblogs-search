         PC World reports that  eBay has set up a recycling initiative called rethink. The web site includes organizations that will accept donations or recycle your old equipment. In the Seattle area, the  Take It Back Network will accept your old equipment for reuse or recycling. 
 On the other hand, I have equipment so old nobody would take it.
