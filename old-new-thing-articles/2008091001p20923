         Master storyteller Ira Glass  teaches us how to tell a story, and the importance of the moment of reflection. (In the third video he explains why when you are trying to do something creative you always suck, and that’s okay.) 
 And once you’ve soaked up Ira’s advice, you can admire Kasper Hauser’s parodies:  Going Postal and  Phantom High School.
