        Mark Zbikowski told me a story from the early Windows NT days. 
 He found a race condition in the file system code and went to see the lead developer for the I/O subsystem. 
“There are no bugs in the I/O Manager,” the developer proclaimed. 
Mark walked through the scenario to demonstrate the problem. 
The lead developer went to his editor and typed furiously for two or three minutes, ending with a theatrical punch of the Enter key. 
And he turned to Mark and proclaimed, “There are no bugs in the I/O Manager.”
