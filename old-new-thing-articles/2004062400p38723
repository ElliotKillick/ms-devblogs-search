        Finnish Radio station YLE  offers  weekly news summaries  in classical Latin.  Because practically nobody outside Finland would understand the news  in Finnish…
  In my random travels around the Internet,  I    stumbled across this article on the subject of teaching Finnish  to foreigners:  Finnish’s status as an official EU language  has created demand for interpreters.  Finns have long accepted that they will have to learn the languages  of others, considering the language’s comparatively minor exposure  on the world stage.  But now, others will have to learn Finnish!
  I occasionally toy with the idea of learning Finnish myself but  each time conclude that it would be too much work.  Though I do have as a long-term goal to learn the major modern  Germanic languages. In probable order of study:  English, German, Swedish, Norwegian, Dutch, Afrikaans, and Icelandic.
  (Hey, I left out Danish.)
