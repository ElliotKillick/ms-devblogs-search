        Last year, our friends over in the Fargo campus  mocked us wusses for shutting down the campus over something as weenie as a touch of snow. Yesterday, there was a safety alert on the internal company home page:
  Alert 
 The Fargo Campus is closed effective immediately due to inclement weather. The City of Fargo is pulling the plows from the snow emergency routes. Employees are encouraged to leave the Fargo Campus. 

 Yup,  Fargo has been shut down due to  inclement weather. 
 Explanation for people who don’t get it: Both this and the mock weather advisory issued by the Fargo campus are just examples of friendly teasing between the Redmond and Fargo campuses, like cousins who live in different parts of the country. I encourage readers to interpret the teasing in the spirit in which it was intended. (Though given the nitpicking from yesterday, I’m not sure this caution will be heeded.)
