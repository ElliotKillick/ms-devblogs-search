The easy one-stop-shopping
way to get the icon for a file is to use the
SHGet­File­Info
function with the SHGFI_ICON flag.
One quirk of the SHGet­File­Info function is that
if you pass the path to a shortcut file,
it will always place the shortcut overlay
on the icon,
regardless of whether you passed the
SHGFI_ADD­OVERLAYS flag.
(Exercise: What is so special about the
shortcut overlay that makes it
exempt from the powers of the
SHGFI_ADD­OVERLAYS flag?
The information you need is on the MSDN page for
SHGet­File­Info,
though you’ll have to apply some logic to the sitaution.)


I’m using SHGet­File­Info to get the icon of a file to
display in my application.
When the file is a shortcut,
rather than displaying the exe icon with a link overlay
(as in SHGFI_LINK­OVERLAY)
I’d like to display the original exe icon.
Is there a way to do this with SHGet­File­Info? Thanks,


First, correcting a minor error in the question:
The icon for a shortcut is, by default, the icon for the shortcut
target,
but it doesn’t have to be.
The IShell­Link::Set­Icon­Location method
lets you set the icon for a shortcut to anything you like.
(This is the method used when you click Change Icon
on the shortcut property page.)


Anyway,
the SHGet­File­Info function gets the icon first
by asking the shell namespace for the icon index in the system
imagelist,
and then converting that imagelist/icon index into a HICON.
If you want to change the conversion, you can just ask
SHGet­File­Info to stop halfway and then finish
the process the way you like.


HICON GetIconWithoutShortcutOverlay(PCTSTR pszFile)
{
 SHFILEINFO sfi;
 HIMAGELIST himl = reinterpret_cast<HIMAGELIST>(
  SHGetFileInfo(pszFile, 0, &sfi, sizeof(sfi),
                SHGFI_SYSICONINDEX));
 if (himl) {
  return ImageList_GetIcon(himl, sfi.iIcon, ILD_NORMAL);
 } else {
  return NULL;
 }
}


Of course,
if you’re going to be doing this for a lot of files,
you may want to just stop once you have the imagelist and the index,
using Image­List_Draw to draw the image when necessary,
instead of creating thousands of little icons.
