         Upon arriving at the office, I unpack my bicycle bag and remove a crisp new white shirt. I change into my work clothes, and then at 11am, I head to lunch as I usually do. (This is the lunch group that includes JeffDav and occasionally BenCon.) I get a sandwich, sit down, and immediately drip sauce on my brand new shirt. Canâ€™t even keep a shirt clean for two hours. Fortunately, I keep a spare shirt in my office so I am able to change and give the now-no-longer-purely-white shirt a bit of a wash in the bathroom sink before the stain set.
