          Norway locks its grip on “Best place to live” status:  

    Norway bans smoking in bars and restaurants.  
    Smokers hanging around outside bars = new dating scene.  

    As I pointed out last month,  this then leads to…  

    Norway is world leader in casual sex.  
    Norway ranked as #1 best place to live.  

  Shoulda studied Norwegian    like I had planned to do originally before I got sidetracked by Swedish.
