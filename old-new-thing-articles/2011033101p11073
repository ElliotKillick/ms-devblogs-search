         It’s that time again: Linking to other Microsoft bloggers. 

          Alphabet soup on the     Office Communicator blog.     Sample sentence:     “OCPE uses AutoDiscover and EWS on the CAS servers.” 
          Alfred Thompson     points out that          Microsoft Mathematics 4.0 is available for free download.     It’s like a graphing calculator on steroids.     (But the good kind of steroids.) 
          Joseph Conway     lists          questions you shouldn’t call Microsoft for. 
          Larry Osterman     highlighted somebody who          reinterpreted the MSPAINT.EXE file as sound data, then played it.     (The author          admitted to removing a long section of noise,     which means you’re probably listening to the resources.) 
          Eric Lippert (the technology blogger,     not          the professional golfer)     takes a break from writing about programming languages     to tell the story of          a weird coincidence.     The story reminds me of my own random-neighbor incident     from the time before     I burst onto the public stage with this Web site.     I was chatting with a friend on the front lawn of the house     he recently purchased, and a passer-by stopped by to say hello     to the new neighbor on the street.     My friend casually introduced me as “Raymond” but the     remark drew no particular reaction.     When the conversation concluded,     the gentleman took his leave and headed back down the street,     but he stopped, looked at me, then pointed at me     with a sort of dawning     realization, saying,     “Hey, you’re Raymond Chen.” 
          Steve Clayton          shares some Out of office autoreplies he’s written.     Lately, I’ve managed to          make my OOF even shorter.     Now it simply reads     “Nice try.” 
     On the          Visual C++ Team Blog,     Vaishnavi Sannidhanam explains          how to file meaningful bugs against Visual C++.     The products in question may have shipped, but the overall     principles of bug reporting are still sound. 
     The mysterious          Hans VB     points out that          the Windows 7 User Experience Interaction Guidelines     are available. 
          Ingolfur Arnar Stangeland     explains the difference between          QFE/LDR and GDR hotfixes. 
          Joseph Conway     (yup the same Joseph Conway)     looks at the hotfix installation process by answering the question          Why are all the files not installed when you install a hotfix?
