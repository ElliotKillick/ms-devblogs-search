         I dreamed that I discovered a path behind my house that led to a playground. It also led to the house of one of my friends. To access to the path from her house, you had to swing the stove away from the wall, exposing a secret door. 
 Also, she drove her house to Europe. (“No need to pack your suitcases, kids. We’re taking the whole house!”)
