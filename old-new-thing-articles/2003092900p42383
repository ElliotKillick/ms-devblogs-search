         Here are some things I learned in Sweden, Germany and Denmark.      

             If you are an airplane pilot, you should avoid communicating on the emergency frequency             unless you have an actual emergency.          
             In Sweden, marmalade comes in a flexible tube that looks like a really fat sausage.          
             Swedes can’t handle spicy-hot food.          
             Road warning signs are blue-and-yellow in Sweden, but red-and-white in Denmark.          
             You can drive really, really fast on the Autobahn.          
             Never drive in the left lane of the Autobahn unless you are actively passing somebody.          
             When you ask at the cafeteria, “Gibt’s Fleisch dabei?”, and the guy says, “Nein, s’gibt             kein Schweinfleisch”, don’t assume that he understood your question.         
             If somebody at Oktoberfest challenges you to drink your one-liter Maßbier in twenty             seconds, you should decline.          
             If you vomit at Oktoberfest, they charge €25 to clean it up.          
             You really don’t need to know that much information about lignite mining.          
             Parking in Copenhagen is free on Sunday. Putting money into the machine is a             waste.
