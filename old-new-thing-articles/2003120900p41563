         Robert Scoble posted an entry in his Longhorn         blog on the subject of what the UI defaults should be. It sure has stirred up         a lot of controvery. I may pick at the remarks over the upcoming days, but for now I         posted responses to two of the comments he kicked up.      
We recently did a survey of users of all abilities. Beginners,     intermediates, experts: The number one complaint all of them had about the user interface     – 30% of all respondents mentioned this, evenly spread across all categories – was     “Too many icons on the desktop.” So it’s not just beginners. Experts also don’t like     the clutter. (Yes, I was surprised by the results, too.)
