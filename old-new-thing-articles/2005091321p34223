        Jim Nayder of  The Annoying Music Show pops by NPR studios every so often—hey, guys, if you changed the locks, this might stop him—whereupon he tortures the general public with musical offenses that should be outlawed by the Geneva Conventions. Most recently,  he offered a series of reinterpretations of the works of Elvis Presley. What’s really scary is that the songs presented in the segment are among the less awful offerings. For genuine musical pain, check out Love Me Tender [WMV] [Real] as performed by “Sweden’s Singin’ Sensation”  Eilert Pilarm. (Quick tip: “Lyssna” is Swedish for “listen.”)
