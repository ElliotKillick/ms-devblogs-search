        For those    in the Seattle area who missed it last year,  The Fremont  Outdoor Cinema is screening  Bubba Ho-Tep  on Friday, July 9th.
  Go see it. You won’t be disappointed.  Assuming what you were expecting to see was Elvis fighting a mummy.  With the help of JFK. In a wheelchair.
  If you were expecting something else, then okay maybe you’ll be  disappointed after all.
