         The MPR show Marketplace (note: MPR,         not NPR) had a         brief story about the reaction to China being the host of the         Miss World pageant. (Last story on the page.)      
         What I noticed was the comment at timecode 23:50 from Miss         World – United States Kim Harlan. (Not to be confused with Miss         United States Julie Roberts or Miss         America Erika Harold. Confused yet? Slate         explains.)      
         Where was I? Oh right, the actuality.         Asked to comment on participating in a beauty pageant in China: [Listen]      
I just though everybody would be wearing, little, you know,     Asian outfits, but they’re completely normal, just the way we dress, so.
I     hope she wasn’t planning to win big in the interview portion of the competition.
