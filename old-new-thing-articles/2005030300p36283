        My random walk began at Svenska Dagbladet and the article  Svensk designer upprör skottar, about Swedish designer Johanna Larson whose T-shirt depicting the traffic-cone-wearing Duke of Wellington has sparked a debate in the city.
 The article mentions that the tradition of placing a traffic cone on the head of the Duke is twenty years old, and my search for further information on this ongoing prank led me to  Richard Leyton‘s musings on  whether the traffic cone should be glued in place permanently.
 At the end of his entry, he links to the wonderful web site of  Mr Monkey and in particular  Mr Monkey’s visit to the statue to see it for himself.
 The Mr Monkey web site is one of the hidden treasures of the Internet. Sure, it may not be entirely original, but Mr Monkey himself is so goofy-looking, the pictures are for the most part quite well-composed, and the subtitles are the icing on the cake.
