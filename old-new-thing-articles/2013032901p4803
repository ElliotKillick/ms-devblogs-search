         It’s that time again: Linking to other Microsoft bloggers. 

          How much personalization is the right amount? 
          A lesson in dynamic range. 
          Everyone quotes command line arguments the wrong way,     a companion to          What’s up with the strange treatment of quotation marks and backslashes by CommandLineToArgvW. 
          The Microsoft fallacy.     Nadyne’s third fallacy is something I see when other companies who     are interested in employee blogging ask,     “How does Microsoft’s PR department manage 5000 bloggers     all of whom will say exactly what you tell them to say?”     It makes the underlying assumption that bloggers are          working closely with the PR department,     when in fact I bet most bloggers can’t     even name a single person in the PR department beyond maybe     Frank X. Shaw. 
          Thoughts from the author of cards.dll.     Bonus:          A deck of playing cards based on the images in cards.dll.     (Warning: Web page title and white-on-white text NSFW     by design.) 
          On how writing a compiler makes you a better programmer.     I don’t think I’ve ever written a compiler,     but I’ve written a good number of interpreters.     I guess that makes me a marginally better programmer. 
More information about notification icons,     notification GUIDs,     and how a digital signature          lets your app take its     notification icon to a new location. 
          Calvin Hsia     was Microsoft’s first Most Valuable Professional (MVP).     MVP originally stood for          Most Verbose People, since they were the people who     were most active on the message boards. 
          The Defrag Show     is Channel 9’s tech support and troubleshooting show.     Co-host Gov Maharaj is described in the blurb as     “tech troubleshooter extraordinaire”.     It sounds like an exaggeration, but it’s not.     This show is not to be confused with the similarly-named… 
          Defrag Tools.     This is the show about serious hard-core debugging.     (I’m plugging my friends here, because Gov, Andrew, and I     are frequent contributors to the “Hard-Core Debugging” sessions     at Microsoft’s internal technical conference known as     TechReady.          My TechEd China 2010 presentation was basically a tweaked version     of one of my “Hard-Core Debugging” talks.     Though given the stunned silence from the audience during my     presentation, I figure that either I was phenomenally boring     or that the information was too advanced. Or both.)
