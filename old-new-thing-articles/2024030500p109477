        In general, the Windows syntax for a user in a domain on a system is domain\user or computername\user. A handy abbreviation is using a single period to represent the local computer name. For example, at the main logon screen, if you want to log in as a local account, you can type .\user instead of some monstrosity like DESKTOP-LWFX8QRP\user.
This is also useful when connecting remotely to another system either via Remote Desktop or the Visual Studio remote debugger: You can type .\user to provide a local account on the remote system.
Just a handy little typing-saver for today, that’s all.
