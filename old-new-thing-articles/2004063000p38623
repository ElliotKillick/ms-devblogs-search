        It has become customary in the telecommunications industry  to quote a low price and then add half as much to it  in “fees”.
    Regulatory Programs Fee. It sure sounds like a government tax.  
    It isn’t.  

  There’s been a new round of official-sounding line items on  telephone bills, which are really just ways for telephone companies  to raise rates while still being able to quote a low price.
    The issue was raised as a shareholder proposal in Verizon’s  2004 proxy statement.  The proposal starts out sounding very much like a crackpot  (perhaps because the proposer is a crackpot),  and the logic is rather twisted, but the underlying theme is  still there:  Price hikes disguised as official-sounding fees.
  How I long for the European rule that the quoted price must  accurately represent the actual amount of money you will pay,  including taxes and fees.  None of this “quote a low price and then add a ton of mandatory  surcharges” nonsense.
