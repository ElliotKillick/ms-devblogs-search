This upcoming Sunday is
Mother’s Day in the United States.
In recognition of the holiday last year,
a local church displayed the following message on its message board:
“God couldn’t be / everywhere / so God made mothers / German speaking.”


This explains why your mother speaks German.


POIDH





The church in question has an evening German-language service,
and the advertisement for that service juxtaposed against the
Jewish proverb produced an unexpected result.
