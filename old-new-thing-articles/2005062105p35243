        Let’s see, Google Maps adds the world outside the United States, Canada and the UK, and  people go ga-ga. Nevermind that Google’s new “maps” have nothing beyond country boundaries. “Aww, look at Google, she’s so cute and adorable!”
 I’m sure the people at the existing online map services like  MapQuest and  MSN MapPoint are sitting there like older siblings, wondering when exactly they turned into chopped liver. MSN MapPoint has actual maps of most of Europe, and MapQuest’s library of maps is larger still. (Kathmandu anyone?)  Both sites provide  documentation on  how to link directly to them. Yet they don’t get drooled over.
 Somebody at MapQuest should take out a full page ad that goes something like this: 

 Dear Google Maps, 
 Welcome to the rest of the world! If you ever need driving directions, don’t hesitate to ask. 
 Love ever, MapQuest
