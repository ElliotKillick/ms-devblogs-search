         Hurricane Isabel made a mess of my weekend travel plans, so I decided, “If you can’t         beat ’em, join ’em.” My outbound flight was cancelled, and even with the best possible         substitution – a flight out the very next day – losing a day on a weekend trip pretty         much kills it. So I extended it to a weeklong vacation. Consequently, don’t expect         to see many updates from me for the next week or so. I’ve been led to understand that         some parts of Europe have Internet access (amazing!), so maybe I can sneak something         in, but don’t count on it.      
     My “unplanned emergency vacation” will take me to Copenhagen, Uppsala, Munich, and     Berlin. We’ll see how long before I collapse of exhaustion. (I’m looking forward to     Berlin, though. Last time I was there, there was this big concrete wall.)
