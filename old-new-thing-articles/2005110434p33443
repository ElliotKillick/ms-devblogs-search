         TechNet Magazine has picked me up as a columnist, and in their  November/December 2005 issue they granted me the great honor of being on the back page. My opening salvo is an IT-ized version of  one of my more popular early articles, but future issues will contain never-before-seen random musings on subjects of interest to IT professionals.
 And no, I don’t get paid to write that column either.
