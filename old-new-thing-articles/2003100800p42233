             In Explorer, you can right-click the icon in the caption to get the context menu for     the folder you are viewing. (Very handy for “Search” or “Command Prompt Here”.) Apparently     not enough people realize this. In Windows 95, we tried to make it so most icons on     the screen did something interesting when you right-clicked them.
