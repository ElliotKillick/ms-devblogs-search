        There are two functions for comparing VARIANTs. One comes from the COM team, called VarCmp. Assuming a successful comparison, it returns 


Comparison
Return value


Less than
0 = VARCMP_LT


Equal to
1 = VARCMP_EQ


Greater than
2 = VARCMP_GT


This is consistent with the other Var­Xxx functions. 
On the other hand, the Variant­Compare function comes from the shell, and it returns 


Comparison
Return value


Less than
−1


Equal to
0


Greater than
+1


Yuck. 
So be careful which one you’re calling and how you’re testing the result.
