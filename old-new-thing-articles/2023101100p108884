        If you use IFileDialog with the FOS_FORCE­FILE­SYSTEM flag, or SHBrowseForFolder with the BIF_RETURN­ONLY­FS­DIRS flag, the dialog nevertheless shows non-filesystem folders, and if users pick one, they are told “You can’t save here.” Why show users folders that they can’t pick?
Because they may need to pass through these unpickable folders in order to get something that they can pick.
If the folder picker dialogs suppressed unpickable folders, then that would make it impossible to pick any of you local drives because they all live inside the unpickable “This PC” node!
Each IShellFolder can report that an item could potentially lead to a file system location by setting the SFGAO_FILE­SYS­ANCESTOR attribute. If that attribute is reported, then the item will appear in the file picker dialogs. It may not itself be pickable, but it needs to be shown because it potentially leads to pickable items.
