Here’s a question that floated past my view:


Anybody know if there exists a library for computing MD5 hashes
from unmanaged code?
MSDN has information about .NET classes,
but nothing about the unmanaged side.


Hm, let’s see.


C:\Windows SDK\Include> grep MD5 *.h
wincrypt.h:#define ALG_SID_MD5                     3
wincrypt.h:#define ALG_SID_SSL3SHAMD5              8
wincrypt.h:#define CALG_MD5                (ALG_CLASS_HASH | ALG_TYPE_ANY | ALG_SID_MD5)
wincrypt.h:#define CALG_HUGHES_MD5         (ALG_CLASS_KEY_EXCHANGE|ALG_TYPE_ANY|ALG_SID_MD5)
wincrypt.h:#define CALG_SSL3_SHAMD5        (ALG_CLASS_HASH | ALG_TYPE_ANY | ALG_SID_SSL3SHAMD5)
wincrypt.h:#define KP_PRECOMP_MD5          24
wincrypt.h:#define szOID_RSA_MD5RSA        "1.2.840.113549.1.1.4"
wincrypt.h:#define szOID_RSA_MD5           "1.2.840.113549.2.5"


Wow, those hits sure look promising.
Perhaps a search on

Windows Live
or

Google¹ will turn up something.
Oh hey, how about that,

sample code.


Exercise:
Use this exact same technique to answer

this commenter’s question
on how the C# ++ operator works.
Hint:
Since this is a question about the C# language,

the C# language specification
would be a good starting point.
