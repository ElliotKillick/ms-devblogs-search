        Here’s a sily Alexa trick.
Use the Alexa app to set the language to something other than English, say, French.
Ask Alexa a question. It will respond in French.
Use the Alexa app to set the language to US-English.
Say, “Alexa, repeat that.”
Alexa will repeat the French response, but using the US-English speech synthesizer, which means it will be speaking French words with a horrible American accent.

            Follow
