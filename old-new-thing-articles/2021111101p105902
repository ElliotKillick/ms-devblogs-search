        In college, a friend of mine gave me his old flute to entice me into taking up the instrument. He noted, “The low notes are kind of bad on this one.”
And he was right. I indeed had difficulty playing the low notes with that flute. I blamed the flute.
Fast-forward five years. I visited a relative who played the flute. I tried out her flute. I still couldn’t hit the low notes reliably.
So all those years, it wasn’t the flute. It was me.
I sort of knew that, but that destroyed the last shred of hope that it was just the flute.
