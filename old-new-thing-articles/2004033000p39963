        Ah, welcome to  “Tiny  Footprint Mode“.
  This mode exists for the ultrageeks who want to put a tiny little CPU  meter in the corner of the screen.  To go back to normal mode,  just double-click a blank space in the border.
  This is one of those geek features that has created more problems  than it solved.  Sure, the geeks get their cute little CPU meter in the corner,  but for each geek that does this, there are  thousands of normal users who accidentally go into Tiny mode  and can’t figure out how to get back.
