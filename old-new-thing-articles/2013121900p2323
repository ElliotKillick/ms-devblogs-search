Suppose you have a program that is written in Arabic or Hebrew
and you want to render some text.
No problem.
You just call
Ext­Text­Out and pass the
ETO_RTL­READING flag to say,
“Please render this string in an RTL context.”
Many other text-rendering functions have a similar flag,
such as
DT_RTL­READING for
Draw­Text.


But what if you don’t control the call to
Ext­Text­Out or Draw­Text
or whatever other function is being used to render the text.
If you don’t control the call, then you can’t pass along the
magic “Please render this string in an RTL context” flag.


If you’re lucky, the component that is doing the rendering has
some analogous flag that tells it to render in RTL context.
If the component is a control,
this flag may be implicit in the
WS_EX_RTL­READING extended style
on the control window itself.
For some components, the secret signal is

the presence of two RLM characters (U+200F) at the beginning of the string.


If you’re not lucky, then the component that is doing the rendering
gives you no way to convince or cajole it into rendering text
in an RTL context.
But all hope is not lost:
The
(possibly
non-intuitive)
Unicode Bidi algorithm comes to the rescue!


What you can do is place the RLE control character (U+202B)
at the start of the string.
The RIGHT-TO-LEFT EMBEDDING control character means
“Treat the text that follows in an RTL context until further instructions.”
(You cancel the effect of an RLE by a PDF (POP DIRECTIONAL
FORMATTING, U+202C).)


Let’s demonstrate in our

scratch program.


#define THESTRING L"\x0639\x0644\x0649 \x0633\x0628\x064a\x0644 " \
                  L"\x0627\x0644\x0645\x062b\x0627\x0644: " \
                  L"Dear \x0623\x0634\x0631\x0641 " \
                  L"\x0645\x0627\x0647\x0631"
#define RLE L"\x202b"
void ShowString(HDC hdc, int y, PCWSTR psz, UINT format)
{
 RECT rc = { 0, y, 500, y+100 };
 DrawTextW(hdc, psz, -1, &rc, format);
}
void
PaintContent(HWND hwnd, PAINTSTRUCT *pps)
{
 ShowString(pps->hdc, 0, THESTRING, 0);
 ShowString(pps->hdc, 100, THESTRING, DT_RTLREADING);
 ShowString(pps->hdc, 200, RLE THESTRING, 0);
}


This sample program takes

a string in Arabic
(with a little bit of English thrown in just to make the difference
more noticeable)
and renders it three ways:


As an LTR string with no special formatting.
As an RTL string with no special formatting.
As an LTR string with an RTL context imposed via the RLE control character.


Observe that in the first case, the string treats the Arabic
at the beginning and end of the string as Arabic text embedded
in an English sentence,
so it is formatted as



على
سبيل
المثال:
Dear

أشرف ماهر


In the second case, the entire string is treated as an Arabic sentence
with an English word stuck inside it.
Therefore, it comes out as

على
سبيل
المثال:

Dear
أشرف ماهر


In the third case, we force the string to be treated as an Arabic
sentence by using the RLE control character.
The result matches the second string.


Note that the formatting is still not ideal because the underlying
canvas is still LTR:
The text is left-justified instead of right-justified,
and the caption buttons on the window
will still be drawn in the LTR position.
But it’s better than nothing.
