         For  many  years,  I’ve  put  together a  little  pocket  guide  to the  Seattle  Symphony  subscription  season for my symphony friends to help them decide which ticket package they want. At some point, we may start subscribing again, but for now, we pick-and-choose individual concerts.
Here’s the at-a-glance season guide for the 2020/2021 season, still with no comments from me because it’s not worth trying to rate every piece to help my friends pick one concert. If you’re my friend and want recommendations, just call. Besides, you can probably preview nearly all of the pieces nowadays (minus the premieres) by searching on YouTube.

 Official brochure. It’s called the “2021 season” because it’s short for “2020/2021”, not because it covers only the year 2021.

For those not familiar with the Seattle Symphony ticket package line-ups: Most of the ticket packages are named Masterworks nX where n is the number of concerts in the package, and the letter indicates the variation. Ticket packages have been combined if they are identical save for the day of the week. For example, 8C and 8D are the same concerts; the only difference is that 8C is for Thursday nights, while 8D is for Saturday nights.
Notes and changes:

The 7[AB], 8[CD], and 7[EF] concert series do not overlap, so you can create your own pseudo-series by taking any two of them, or recreate the 22-concert series by taking all three.
The 13-concert series is the same as the 8[CD] and 7[EF] series combined, minus the November 19 and February 18 concerts.
Conductor Emeritus Ludovic Morlot returns to the podium for the concerts on the weekend of June 10.
Not included above are other regular series that do not overlap with the Masterworks series: Pops, Recitals, [untitled] (contemporary music), Chamber music, Family Concerts, and Tiny Tots.
Last season, the Baroque and Wine series struck out on its own and had no overlap with the Masterworks series, but this season it connects back to the Masterworks series via the Four Seasons concert on October 25.
The Seattle Symphony  Family Connections program is still going. It provides free symphony tickets for up to two children with the purchase of an adult ticket.
Khatia Buniatishvili is this year’s artist in residence, which I think will be very exciting. She performs  on opening night and  in recital.
Violinist Ray Chen performs  in recital. No relation.
Once again, there is a June Beethoven Festival, commemorating the composer’s 250th birthday. It performs the complete symphonies alongside contemporary works. 1 and 3, 2 and 7, 6 and 8, 4 and 5, 9.
There are always one-off concerts scattered through the year.
Over the years, the format of the Seattle Symphony official brochure has gradually gotten closer and closer to the format of this pocket guide. This makes my job both easier and arguably superfluous.

Update: The entire 2020–2021 season was cancelled due to the  COVID-19 pandemic. Replacement concerts were held with no audience physically present, and the live stream was made available to all subscribers regardless of ticket package. Selections marked with a § symbol were from cancelled concerts in the original 2019–2020 or 2020–2021 schedule.
