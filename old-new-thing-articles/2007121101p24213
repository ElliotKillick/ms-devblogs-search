         In early 1997, the movie Fly Away Home, a film about a teenage girl and her father rescuing a family of geese (inspired by Operation Migration), was released on DVD. the movie was  well-reviewed and even earned an Academy Award nomination. The very same weekend, the movie with the very similar name  Follow Me Home was released in theaters.  Its critical reception was less favorable. Coincidence? Or  exploiting the inattentive?
