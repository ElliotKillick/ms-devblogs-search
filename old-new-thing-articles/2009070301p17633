        A follow-up to  why ABBA songs are so catchy:  Vitaly Komar, Alex Melamid, and  David Soldier developed a song  scientifically engineered  to be the most unwanted song ever: By their calculations, “fewer than 200 individuals of the world’s total population would enjoy this piece.”
 Ah, opera rap.

America’s Most Wanted Painting contains “an autumnal landscape with wild animals, a family enjoying the outdoors, the color blue,  and George Washington.”
