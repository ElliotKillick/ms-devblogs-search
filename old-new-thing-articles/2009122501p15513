         My article some time back about  accidentally destroying my beloved Zune headphones resulted in a number of people sending me their unwanted Zune headphones via inter-office mail. This was not my intention when I posted the article—if that were my goal, I would have posted the article immediately instead of waiting a year and a half!—but it was nevertheless a pleasant surprise. Every so often  strangers come through. 
 Thanks, everybody.
