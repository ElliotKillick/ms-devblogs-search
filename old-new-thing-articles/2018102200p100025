        A customer observed that sometimes the Entry Point Not Found error dialog does not include the name of the missing entry point.
Usually, it looks like this:

Contoso.exe – Entry Point Not Found



⊗
The procedure entry point WidgetStart could not be located in the dynamic link library widget.dll.




OK






But sometimes it looks like this:

Contoso.exe – Entry Point Not Found



⊗
The procedure entry point  could not be located in the dynamic link library widget.dll.




OK






Why does the error message sometimes leave out the name of the missing entry point?
If the entry point name is longer than 128 characters, then it is omitted from the error message. The most common reason for having a very long function name is that you exported decorated C++ functions, because C++ function decoration can result in very long names.
