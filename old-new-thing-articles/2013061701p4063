         I dreamed that I was playing doubles tennis. My partner was Boris Becker. Our opponents were the Queen of England and a policeman on a horse. The horse served his horseshoe, which I returned poorly. As the horseshoe bounced across the ground, it made huge divots. The game was called due to poor ground conditions. 
 The Queen played a game with the crowd by pretending to sit down (allowing everybody to sit), then faking them out and standing (making everybody stand up again).
