        The semi-annual link clearance is here! 

    Windows 8 comes with a data compression API.     I was going to write a Little Program to demonstrate it,     but it turns out         the MSDN sample pretty much covers it,     so I’ll just incorporate it by reference. 
    James Mickens says,     “Life is terrible:     Let’s talk about the Web“.     (Mickens appears to be making fun of Sweden in this talk.     The candles on the head are a tradition from         St. Lucy’s Day.) 
    Tony Zhou explains         why Jackie Chan is the master of action comedy. 
        The formula for an episode of Murder: She Wrote 
        I’m Not Russell Wilson, But I Play Him on TV:     The story of the people who play football in commercials,     movies, and TV shows. 
    The show is on past my bedtime,     but I was intriguged by         how they created the SNL title sequence.     Favorite part: bokeh.     TL;DR: They used a variety of in-camera techinques. 
    I am fascinated by the processes that operate behind the scenes.         Floating Feasts     describes what it takes to feed an entire cruise ship,     specifically Royal Caribbean’s Oasis.     A dozen pillow-sized bags of uncooked French fries?     “That’s about five minutes’ worth.”     The passengers “eat a metric ton of lobster during a typical     seven-day cruise.”     Also fascinating is how food consumption varies with     the type of passengers. 
        Wander around the Allure of the Seas,     courtesy of Google Street View.     (The Allure of the Seas is the sister ship of the Oasis.) 
    Because Japan:     Bijin-tokei,     the “beauty clock”.     Operated by the Japanese modeling agency     Bijin. 
    Because Japan:         Another Japanese clock (warning: strange music),     this one run by Japanese casual-clothing company     Uniqlo.     I can’t describe this one except to say that it’s from Japan.     (They also have a     calendar     consisting of tilt-shift time-lapse movies.) 
    6502 flashback:         Steve Wozniak’s Sweet 16 interpreter for the 6502.     It’s been quipped that the 6502 is really a RISC chip with 256 registers     (the zero page), with the caveat that you have to write your     program in microcode.     Woz does it in 300 bytes.     Because he’s Woz. 
    6502 flashback:         Floating point routines for the 6502,     by Roy Rankin and Steve Wozniak.     This, my friends, is how real programmers do it. 
    And the last double of the day:     Star Trek Continues,     Star Trek New Voyages: Phase II.     (Bonus reading:         Getting every set detail down.)
