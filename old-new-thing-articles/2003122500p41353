         The programs in the startup group run in an unspecified order. Some people think they execute in the order they were created. Then you upgraded from Windows 98 to Windows 2000 and found that didn’t work any more. Other people think they execute in alphabetical order. Then you installed a Windows XP  multilingual user interface language pack and found that didn’t work any more either. 
 If you want to control the order that programs in the startup group are run, write a batch file that runs them in the order you want and put a shortcut to the batch file in your startup group.
