         Useless trivia day.     
         Why is a registry file called a “hive”?     
         Because one of the original developers of Windows NT hated bees.  So the developer         who was responsible for the registry snuck in as many bee references as he could.          A registry file is called a “hive”, and registry data are stored in “cells”, which         is what honeycombs are made of.
