        If you lived in the New York metropolitan area in the 1980’s, you couldn’t avoid the advertisements for electronics store  Crazy Eddie. What I didn’t realize until now was that the retail establishment  was a criminal operation from day one. Sam Antar, Crazy Eddie CFO, and nephew of company namesake Eddie Antar, talks us through the entire operation  in this riveting interview. Along the way, you’ll learn why it was at first advantageous to under-report revenues, then later why it became advantageous to return the unreported money back to the system.
