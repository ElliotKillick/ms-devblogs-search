        Password was one of the classic game shows. Its methodical pace encouraged thoughtful play, as opposed to today’s game shows which appear to rely on dramatic music and ominous spotlights for their appeal.
 This is  not a clip from the game show but rather a scene from the comedy The Odd Couple in which the two characters are contestants, and as you might expect from a sitcom, they fail spectacularly. But even from the clip, you can get a pretty good feel for how the game is played.
  The new version is nothing like it. It’s really “try to guess a word which your partner describes in three words.”
 The strategy of deciding whether to “pass or play”: Gone.
 Picking up a miss from the opponent: Gone.
 It sounds like  the folks at BuzzerBlog aren’t big fans of the remake either.
