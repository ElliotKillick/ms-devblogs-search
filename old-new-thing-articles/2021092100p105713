        Some time ago, I noted that  The NET HELPMSG command will decode Windows error codes, at least the simple ones.
Stefan Kanthak pointed out that thereâ€™s another built-in program for converting numbers to error messages, and it handles a lot more error numbers and formats than NET HELPMSG does.
certutil /error 2
certutil /error 0x80070002
certutil /error -2147024894
certutil /error 2147942402
certutil /error -0x7ff8fffe

The first one says
0x2 (WIN32: 2 ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND) -- 2 (2)
Error message text: The system cannot find the file specified.
CertUtil: -error command completed successfully.

The others say the same thing, but with a different error number:
0x80070002 (WIN32: 2 ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND) -- 2147942402 (-2147024894)
Error message text: The system cannot find the file specified.
CertUtil: -error command completed successfully.
