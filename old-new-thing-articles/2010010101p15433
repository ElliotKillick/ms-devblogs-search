        Darek Mihocka, proprietor of  emulators.com, and whom I linked to  a few years ago,  released the source code to Atari ST emulator Gemulator 9.0, and in celebration, he also posted his 1992 promotional video to YouTube: Part 1, Part 2, Part 3.
 Warning: It’s a really bad video. The music, the hair, the cheesy video effects, the bad acting, oh did I mention the hair? But it’s also a trip in the wayback machine.
 Pre-emptive snarky comment: “You idiot, you got the quote wrong. It’s ‘My eyes! The goggles do nothing!‘”
