        Apparently there are a lot of strange dictionaries out there.
 Otherwise-well-respected German dictionary publisher  Langenscheidt announced that  it is producing a German-Woman/Woman-German dictionary. (Psst, Toronto Star, it’s “Also sprachen die Fräulein”… Third person plural, past tense of strong verb, ending is “en”. You’re welcome.) 
 We also have  The Hippie Dictionary which translates such words and phrases like “stay loose”, “hey man”, and “like”.
