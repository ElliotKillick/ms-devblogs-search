        I dreamed that I had to drive from Los Angeles to Berkeley to catch my flight home. To do this, I used a product from a local startup company: A computerized map of the Bay Area.
 There were two routes across Lake Saskatchewan. The southern route is highway I-70, and the northern route is an elevated highway that goes right past the head of the Canadian Statue of Freedom, a 300-foot-tall statue carved from a single rock. This shows that computer nerds are horrible cartographers:  Berkeley has an airport, Los Angeles is on the peninsula just south of San Francisco, and the Bay Area is in Canada. 
 Sure, this is an absurd dream, but you gotta admit, that shortcut across Lake Saskatchewan would be pretty awesome.
