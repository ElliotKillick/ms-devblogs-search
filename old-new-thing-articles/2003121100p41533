         Slashdot‘s story about the amateur         adventurer who is now stranded at McMurdo Base (because he underestimated his         fuel requirements for a trip over the South Pole) reminded me of a controversy abrew         at the other end of the planet: The         hole at the North Pole. To resolve this matter, Steve         Currey is mounting an expedition to the hole at the top of the earth. Reserve         your seat now!  For only $20,000, you too can travel to the hole in the North         Pole and glory at the tropical landscape that awaits you. Maybe.
