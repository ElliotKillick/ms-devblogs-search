         What does a Mandarin-speaking American woman in Beijing do? If youâ€™re Rachel DeWoskin, you  serendipitously wind up the star of a daytime Mandarin-language soap opera called Foreign Babes in Beijing, a show that takes all the Western stereotypes (from the Chinese point of view) and milks them for all their melodramatic worth. (They probably watched too much Dallas.)
