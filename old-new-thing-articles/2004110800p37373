         I think it is a trait common to many people that they are fascinated by how their country is viewed by others. The leftist Die Tageszeitung from Germany  reacted to the result of the most recent U.S. presidential election with their list of  one hundred things that are still better in the United States. 
 Those who cannot read German can use  a translation provided by a Metafilter reader (which is where I found this article, if you haven’t figured it out). But of course it’s better to read something in its original language if you can.
