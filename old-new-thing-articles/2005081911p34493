        One of our researchers IM’d me yesterday to let me know that someone she interviewed mentioned that some people suspected that I wasn’t real because most of my posts are published at the same time every day.
 I dunno. The evening news comes on at the same time every day, but I’m pretty sure they’re real. Maybe I should be more suspicious. 
 If I were real.
