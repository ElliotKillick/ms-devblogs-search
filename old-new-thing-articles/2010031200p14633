        In 2006, via the suggestion box,  Chris J asks why the OLE variant date format has such a strange zero point. Its zero point is 30 December 1899, as opposed to 1 January 1900 (SQL Server’s zero point) or 1 January 1970 (the unix zero point).
It turns out I don’t have to answer this because  Eric Lippert explained it three years before the question was posted, and then some time later posted  a puzzle regarding date calculations.
