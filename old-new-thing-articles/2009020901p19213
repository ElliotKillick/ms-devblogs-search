         A thank-you to commenter Greg for pointing it out that the Seattle Symphony made changes to their UBS Masterworks 13 series after the brochures were printed. I compared my printed brochure against  the online one and updated  the 2009/2010 Seattle Symphony subscription season at a glance accordingly. They deleted five concerts and added six, so the Masterworks 13 series actually has 14 concerts. They probably kept the name for backward compatibility.
