          Xeni Jardin on  Boing Boing reports that  the DHS series I mentioned a while back was  all an elaborate scam to bilk investors out of millions. (One tip-off has got to be that they changed their domain name from www.dhs.tv to  www.dhstheseries.tv. And curiously, their “News” page just says P ALIGN"LEFT"/P.)  Read Ms. Jardin’s article for more linkity goodness. I guess this has a good side: It means no FEMA episode.
