        According to the Internet, I have never made a complete visit to the Pacific Northwest. When I searched for the phrase “No trip to the Pacific Northwest is complete without” back in 2013, I learned that, among many other things, I would have to

go whale watching,
shop at the Bravern,
have a drink at Boundary Bay,
visit Glacier National Park in Montana,
take a ferry to Bremerton,
take a trip to Vancouver,
visit the Future of Flight,
eat at Burgerville,
visit Mount Rainier,
take a sightseeing tour of Camano Island.

Apparently, a complete visit to the Pacific Northwest is exhausting.
