        I’m pretty confident I’m going to regret this.
 I have been goaded into  The Double-E Half Hour of Pain, featuring  Eric Gunnerson and  The Fat Cyclist. Indeed, Mr. Cyclist has  already started the trash talk. 
 My strategy will be to start slow and taper off. (Especially since it will have taken me about an hour and a half just to get to the starting point.) 
 I’ll be the one in the black shorts and yellow shirt, with a heavy bicycle and  a withered hand. (I just like saying “withered hand”.)
