        The great thing about Windows file versions is that there are so many to choose from! 
For each file, you have 

Numeric product version
Numeric file version
String product version
String file version

The numeric and string versions generally match, but there is no enforcement. Often the string version incorporates the numeric version but adds some additional information, like 3.1.0.2 (alpha). Sometimes the string version disagrees with the numeric version. This can happen when MUI satellite DLLs enter the picture. 
You can use PowerShell to obtain the version information for a file. 

PS> (Get-Command C:\Path\To\Thing.dll).FileVersionInfo.FileVersion
3.1.0.2

The version number parts of the File­Version­Info are
