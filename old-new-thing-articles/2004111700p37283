Warning: .NET content ahead.
For some reason, this gets asked a lot.


To break an integer into its component bytes, you can use

the BitConverter.GetBytes method:


int i = 123456;
byte[] bytes = BitConverter.GetBytes(i);


After this code fragment, the byte array contains
{ 0x40, 0xE2, 0x01, 0x00 }.


Update 11am:
The endian-ness of the result is determined by

the
BitConverter.IsLittleEndian property.
Thanks to reader Sean McVey for pointing this out.
