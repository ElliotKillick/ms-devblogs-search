        I’ve ranted before about privacy policies and how they don’t  actually protect your privacy.  (All they’re required to do is  disclose the policy; there is no requirement that the policy must  be any good.)
  Today I read    MetLife’s privacy policy and found to my surprise  that it does not actively offend me.  It’s written in plain English,  it’s well-organized,  and it actually explains and limits the scope of  each exception.
  I have noticed  how the word “terrorism” has turned into a “magic word” of late.  Anything distasteful you want to do, just say you’re doing it  to combat “terrorism” and people will give you the green light.
