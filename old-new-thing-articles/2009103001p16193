        Here’s an excerpt from a conversation on the subject of Hallowe’en which I had with my niece some time ago. Let’s call her “Cathy”. (This is  a different Cathy from last time.)
 “Cathy, what do you do on Hallowe’en?”
 “You get all dressed up and people give you candy.”
 “What do you say when people come to the door?”
 “Chuck-E-Cheese!”
