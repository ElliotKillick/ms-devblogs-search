         The  Web page associated with my PDC 2008 talk has been updated to include the source code that I used for all of the demos. 
 Other remarks: 

When I wrote, “If you know what’s good for you, don’t actually use a title image,” that was in the context of using group descriptions. If you watch the video, you’ll see that if you give a group description a title image, the title image is drawn on top of the text, which is, not to put too fine a point on it, hideous. If you’re going to go down the road of using the total information overload of group descriptions, at least use a blank title image. Of course, if you’re not using group descriptions, then go ahead and use title images; they look fine on their own. 
James Senior     posts          more monkey facts about the PDC     as well as a          time lapse video of the keynote room being set up and torn down. 
     Xirrus     issued          a press release on how their devices were used to provide     record-setting wireless connectivity at the PDC. 
          Jon Galloway     gives a behind-the-curtain look at          how the microsoftpdc.com Web site was built. 
     In case you didn’t know,          Windows 7 Developer White Papers     are available for download.     New white papers are added to the list every so often,     so it’s worth another look.
