        While on a trip to Las Vegas, I happened to overhear a woman talking on her mobile phone who, from her body language, was clearly trying to meet up with a friend. We were in the casino of one of the major hotels. She said, “I’m over here by the slot machines.”
 Yeah, that narrows it down.
 I’ll be heading to Vegas for the  Niney Awards. If I don’t see you at the ceremony, I’ll meet you by the slot machines.
