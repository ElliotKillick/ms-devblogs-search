The primary monitor by definition has its upper left corner at
(0, 0).
Therefore, you can use this function:


HMONITOR GetPrimaryMonitorHandle()
{
 const POINT ptZero = { 0, 0 };
 return MonitorFromPoint(ptZero, MONITOR_DEFAULTTOPRIMARY);
}


To make double extra sure (belt and suspenders),
we also tell it, “If you’re not sure
what monitor to return, give us the primary.”


Sure, this sounds obviously simple, but I actually found somebody
who

fumbled around in the dark passing intentionally invalid
parameters
to MonitorFromWindow trying to find one
that would return the primary monitor handle.
(I’ve heard this called Programming By Accident.)
