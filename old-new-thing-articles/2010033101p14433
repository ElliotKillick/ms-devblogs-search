         It’s that time again: Sending some link love to my colleagues. 

          Names and file system filters.     Even if you aren’t interested in file system filters     (and you probably aren’t),     the discussion of names is very interesting,     particularly in light of          the confusion over hard links     and the difference between a file and its names. 
          Mark Russinovich          creates 16 million handles in a single process.     Famous last words: “16 million handles should be enough for anybody.”     And learn that a handle isn’t really an index into an array.     (If handles were kept in an array,     then the kernel would find itself having to reallocate a     a 16-million-element array.) 
          Larry Osterman     digs into     the etymology of the Microspeak term          giblet. 
          Joey deVilla     points out a little-known Bing search operator          which shows all domains registered at a particular IP address. 
          Shawn Steele     explains          pseudo-locales,     which look an awful lot like l33t.          Michael Kaplan     begs you          not to call it ps-ps. 
          Michael Kaplan     sarcastically observes that Notepad is          the apparent premiere tool of UNIX shell script authors     throughout the world.     (I wish I could get away with being as snarky as Michael.) 
     DPI emulation normally kicks in when the logical DPI is set above 120.          Kam VedBrat     explains how you can          enable DPI emulation at lower DPI levels. 
     The          ESL Assistant          team blog     introduces, well, the     ESL Assistant,     a Web page to assist non-native speakers of English with their writing.     “Introduce” is a misnomer here, since the ESL Assistant has been     around since 2008. Too bad nobody knows about it. 
          Eric Lawrence’s IEInternals     discusses          The User Agent String: Use and Abuse.     Eric’s blog is full of good in-depth stuff like this,     like          Understanding Domain Names in Internet Explorer,     which discusses the difficulty of trying to figure out     where the important part of the domain name is. 
          The Larry Osterman trifecta is now in play.     This time, he shares          his own take     on          the cost of updating everything. 
          Tina Wood     gives a glimpse behind the curtain of          Life at Microsoft: The truth revealed.     There’s also          a second episode. 
     Adrian Marinescu          discusses the heap manager.     Silviu Calinoiu          discusses the fault-tolerant heap.     Richard Johnson     presents [ppt]     some implementation details of the low fragmentation heap     (from a security perspective). 
          What happens when the network goes down.     (Related to          What happens when the power goes out.) 
          Janne Mattila          repurposes Internet Explorer 8’s InPrivate Filtering as an ad-blocker. 
     Eric Lippert     has          his own exercise in psychic debugging.     (Answer.)     Understanding this puzzle means that you don’t need to have          this subtlety of the Zip sequence operator explained to you. 
          How to enable the light sensor on your laptop     and what it gets you. 
     The          NTdebugging blog     has examples of all sorts of debugging techniques.     It has a kernel-mode focus,     but          there’s user-mode stuff mixed in there occasionally. 
          Alan Page     builds on          Eric Sink’s article Why we all sell code with bugs     (long     version)     with his own explanation of          why bugs don’t get fixed. 
     I asked          Rico Mariani     to share his story about the clever way he addressed     unmanaged heap fragmentation back in the late 1990’s.     Turns out          he did it years ago and I missed it. 
          Shawn Hargreaves     tells a story about          a bug whose effect was so awesome it became a feature. 
     Over on the          fontblog,     Kevin Larson          debunks an Internet myth about ltteer scrmbaling. 
     On the          Windows Installer Team Blog,     Hemchander     discusses          Windows Installer and the Restart Manager,     and way at the bottom is information on how you can make your     program survive an update-triggered reboot. 
          Keith Combs     points us to     the surprising          showdown between a shark and an octopus.     (Older grainier video.)     Was this the inspiration for          Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus?     (Oh, and          the octopus had help.) 
          Brandon Paddock     demystifies          The so-called “God Mode”:     It’s just part of the plumbing that drives     the Start menu and Control Panel search functions.     We saw something like this before,     when people took the Copy To and Move To     toolbar buttons and          turned them into context menu items.     In both cases, you’re using something in a manner it was not designed for     or tested for, so if it doesn’t work, well, nobody promised that it would. 
          Roberto Alexis Farah     shows us another cool debugger command:          !findstack. 
     danah boyd     posted          the speaker notes for her SXSW keynote     Making Sense of Privacy and Publicity.     She gave          a longer version of the same talk to Microsoft employees     two weeks earlier. 
     Larry Osterman explains          what’s up with the Beep driver.
