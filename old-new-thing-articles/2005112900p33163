         You can tell right away that  Jan Miksovsky’s flow|state is about user interface design. I’ve had the pleasure of working with Jan when he was at Microsoft. Whereas I focus on the mechanics of making a user interface happen, Jan looks at the bigger problems of design and interface architecture. For example, in this entry he  considers the issue of asking the user unnecessary questions and highlights some ways you can avoid hassling the user with a barrage of questions while still giving the user the ability to answer the question if they choose to. Good stuff.
