        Apparently that’s the term for knitting in public.
  The New York Times covered    the online knitting community.  I wasn’t aware of the  Yahoo knitlist group;  I may have to go check it out.
  (The NYT article also mentions the yarn    Fizz, which I have used, but I much prefer    Splash, a totally knock-your-socks-off novelty yarn.  Incorporate Splash into a scarf and you’ve got a friend for life.)
