         One of the consequences of the New Internet World Order is that it is very easy to set up a web site like www.sorryeverybody.com and equally easy to set up a response like  www.notsorryeverybody.com. This state of affairs clearly calls out for some sort of competition between the two. At dinner last night, someone suggested that there should be a site like www.amisorryornot.com? I guess it would have been funnier if the “not sorry” site had pictures of people not being sorry. Then “sorry or not” could have picked a picture and had visitors vote whether the person looked sorry or not… 
 (I have to admit in my consummate geekdom that I think that the funniest “X or not” site is  www.amibiosornot.com.)
