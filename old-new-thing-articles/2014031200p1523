        As I’ve noted before,  the operations team has their own jargon which superficially resembles English. Some time ago, they sent out a message with the subject A New Internet Egress Path Is Coming.
 Translation: We’re changing the way computers access the Internet.
 Bonus jargon: traffic on the edge. This does not refer to traffic that is on the verge of a nervous breakdown. It merely refers to traffic that crosses the boundary between intranet and Internet.
