         Flavenoids         in Guinness combat fatty deposits in arteries. Note, however that the beer was         consumed by being “fed … via tubes directly into their stomachs.”      
     On the other hand, a friend of mine points out, “I thought a tube leading directly     to the stomach was also called the esophagus. That’s my Guinness delivery system.”
