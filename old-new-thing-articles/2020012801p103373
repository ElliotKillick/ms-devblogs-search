         PlayStation UK created a horrific uproar when they proclaimed that  the 🞩 button on the PlayStation controller is called “cross”, and not “X”.
Sure, but I’m still going to call it “X”.
In the United States, the term “cross” is used to refer almost exclusively to the religious symbol 🕇 or shapes similar to it, with the same vertical orientation. It certainly is not commonly used to refer to the rotated symbol 🞩.¹ The name of the rotated symbol is almost uniformly “X”.
The game of Noughts and Crosses is called Tic-Tac-Toe in the States.
¹ We also do not use the word “cross” to mean “angry”. A sentence like “She was cross about the delay” is distinctly British English.
