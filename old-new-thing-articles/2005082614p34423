        Late Tuesday night, Jenny Lam, the creative director for  this year’s PDC, came by our hallway and asked for permission to rummage through our offices for “stuff”. They were looking for props to use to decorate a developer’s cubicle in a video they were filming for the conference. I was able to loan her a framed letter of appreciation and my pass to the Windows 2000 launch. I used to have a lot more junk in my office, but I went on a cleaning binge during our last office move and the really cool mementos ended up at my house. If you watch the movie and squint you might be able to make out my name on the personalized items, but I wouldn’t hold my breath. My stuff will be on screen for probably a quarter of a second, and I’m guessing it won’t be big enough to read anything of significance. (Jenny tells me that one of the things in the cubicle is a forgery. See if you can spot it.)
 They were able to get much cooler stuff from my neighbor’s office. Among other things, he had a chemical model of  the caffeine molecule. 
 Incidentally, Jenny puts my Martha number at two. I’ve met Jenny, and Jenny was personally interviewed by  Martha Stewart. I just think that’s so neat, being two steps away from The Martha.
