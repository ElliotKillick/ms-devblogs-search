        After the first Harry Potter movie came out, I decided to come up with the world’s worst celebrity recasting of the American version of Harry Potter. (Because as we all know, foreign movies don’t do well in the States; they have to be remade with an American cast.) It’s not so much a dream cast as maybe a nightmare. Some of the choices are inspired; others are inspired lunacy.
