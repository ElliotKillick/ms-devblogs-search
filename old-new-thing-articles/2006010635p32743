         Two people pointed out that  the ImageList_Add function and  toolbars use horizontal strips even though we learned that vertical strips are much more efficient. While itâ€™s true that the images are passed to the ImageList_Add and CreateToolbarEx functions in horizontal strips, the image list and toolbar code copy them to a vertical strip. 
 In other words, the horizontal strip is merely an interchange format. Internally, the image list and toolbar use the more efficient vertical arrangement.
