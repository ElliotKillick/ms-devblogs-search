        A quick and dirty way to convert Windows error codes to strings is to use the NET HELPMSG command. 

C:\> NET HELPMSG 2

The system cannot find the file specified.

C:\> NET HELPMSG 8242

An invalid dn syntax has been specified.

The command is not infallible, however. 

It operates only on Windows error codes.     It doesn’t decode HRESULT or     NTSTATUS values. 
It doesn’t support messages with insertions,     presumably because         it doesn’t pass the     FORMAT_MESSAGE_IGNORE_INSERTS     flag. 

If you pass a message with an insertion, such as ERROR_WRONG_DISK, then instead of getting 

The wrong diskette is in the drive.
Insert %2 (Volume Serial Number: %3) into drive %1.

you get¹ 

C:\> NET HELPMSG 34

34 is not a valid Windows network message number.

More help is available by typing NET HELPMSG 3871.

Still, it’s better than nothing. 
¹ As a bonus insult, if you type the suggested command, you get this: 

C:\> NET HELPMSG 3871

*** is not a valid Windows network message number.

Yeah, um, that really didn’t tell me anything new.
