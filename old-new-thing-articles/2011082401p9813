         A sports-related (mostly baseball) link dump. 

A look at          the special dirt that is used by Major League Baseball     to prepare balls for use. 
     As you might have expected,          professional athletes don’t fare all that well financially     once they retire,     or even          while they are still playing.          We sort of knew that going in;     it’s sad that not much has changed. 
          A very weird triple play. 
          The worst plate appearance in the history of baseball.     I even learned a new unit of distance:     the Pedroia.
