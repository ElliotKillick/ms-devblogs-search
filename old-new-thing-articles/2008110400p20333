        Today is Election Day in the United States. Don’t forget to vote. (Void where prohibited.) In honor of Election Day, I figured I’d tell a story about voting.
 One of the complimentary beverages available in Microsoft kitchens is  Spicy Hot V-8. (Sure it’s tasty, but watch out for  the sodium content!) 
 I remember well when Spicy Hot V-8 was added to the refrigerators. At the 1992 Company Meeting, Bill Gates and then-head of HR  Mike Murray appeared on stage to read questions submitted by employees ahead of time. One of the questions was “Can we carry Spicy Hot V-8 in the kitchens?” 
 Mike Murray decided to put the matter to a voice vote. 
 The measure “passed” overwhelmingly. 
 Spicy Hot V-8 appeared in the kitchens the next morning.
