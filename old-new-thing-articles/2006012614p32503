         Stephen Tolouse (known around Microsoft as “stepto”, pronounced “step-toe”) from the  Microsoft Security Response Center reminisces about  Windows 95 RTM. 
 Stephen mentions that “the build numbers were artificially inflated to reach 950”. There’s actually a technical reason for this inflation, which I intend to write about when I have the time to give the topic the treatment it deserves.
