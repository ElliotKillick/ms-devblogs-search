        My friend  ::Wendy:: has many circles of friends, and several of them converged at the  Elephant and Castle Pub in Seattle last week  for her send-off party, resulting in a night-long game of  Venn Diagram as you tried to work out which groups intersected how.
 I got to meet in person some of ::Wendy::’s blogger friends, including  Jennifer (aka “Piehole“) and  LaCroix (not her real name), the person who  tipped me off to Yaktrax earlier this year. Jennifer in real life is pretty much exactly like her blog persona: boistrous and hilariously outrageous. LaCroix was a surprise: Although her writing appears methodical and subdued, in person, she’s intensely energetic and charismatic. Once you start talking with her, you somehow just want to be her friend. It’s no wonder that she has her own  Cafeteria Boyfriends.
 At some point during the evening, I mentioned the movie Darkon, a documentary on the  Darkon Wargaming Club, a band of Live Action Role Playing aficionados, known perhaps pejoratively as larpers. We were all fascinated by the idea of the movie (Grady Hendrix of Slate calls it a “must-see”), but alas it doesn’t appear to be showing in the Seattle area. We’ll just have to wait for it to show up in the video rental stores.
