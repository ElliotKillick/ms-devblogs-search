        A customer asked,
 Is there a way to turn off Full Window Drag on a single window? I have a resizable control that I would like not update itself while resizing. 
 It so happens that I wrote a sample program ages ago to illustrate how to do this. You can find it in the PlatformÂ SDK under winui\fulldrag. The source code is also reproduced in  this Knowledge Base article.
 In addition to deferring painting, you may also want to defer layout if layout is expensive for your window.
