        The PowerShell Get-LocalUser cmdlet gives you information about a local user, including the last logon time.
PS> Get-LocalUser Fred | Format-List

SID                    : S-1-5-21-162119347-98882960-612995125-1001

ObjectClass            : User

How can you get this information from C++?
For historical reasons, commands for operating with local users are in the LAN Manager API family. That’s because MS-DOS was a single-user operating system, so the only time you had to worry about “users” was if you were operating over the network.
This is also why a bunch of user management operations are handled by NET.EXE. The NET.EXE program was the part of LAN Manager that gave you access to all the network magic stuff.
C:\> NET USER Fred

The command completed successfully.

The native function for getting this information is NetUserGetInfo. In particular, asking for information level 2 gives you a USER_INFO_2 structure which contains, among other things, usri2_last_logon.
 The documentation includes a sample program showing how to request various levels of information and then print the results, so I won’t bother repeating it here.
