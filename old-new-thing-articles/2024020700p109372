        When you  use the Drag-Drop Helper Object to get Explorer’s fancy drag/drop effects in your own program, you may find that if the system is in High Contrast mode, then there is no visual feedback.
First of all, good job on testing your program in High Contrast mode.
Up until Windows 7, the Drag-Drop Helper Object does not show fancy drag/drop effects in High Contrast mode because it didn’t render in a High Contrast-y way.
Windows 8 updated the graphics to support High Contrast rendering. But for compatibility reasons, you have to opt in by listing Windows 8 among the supported operating systems in your manifest:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<assembly xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1" manifestVersion="1.0">
  <compatibility xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:compatibility.v1">
    <application>
        <supportedOS Id="{4a2f28e3-53b9-4441-ba9c-d69d4a4a6e38}"/>
    </application>
  </compatibility>
</assembly>
