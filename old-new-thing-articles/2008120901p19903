         In January 2008,  John Bohannon held a contest titled  Dance your PhD, wherein contestants were invited to  express their PhD thesis in five minutes through the medium of dance. It was such a hit that it came back for a sequel:  The 2009 Dance Your Ph.D. contest. 
  Only a Game  interviews John Bohannon [mp3]. You can also watch the winning dance,  The role of vitamin D in beta cell function on YouTube, along with the  other winners.
