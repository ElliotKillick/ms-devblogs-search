        A customer had code that used the Dispatcher­Queue.Has­Thread­Access property, but found that the code crashed when running on Windows Server 2019 systems,¹ because the Has­Thread­Access property wasn’t added until Windows Server Version 1903.
They wondered if there was a way to find out whether you are running on a Dispatcher­Queue‘s thread without using the Has­Thread­Access property?
Well, let’s browse around the members of Dispatcher­Queue:



Member
Available in Server 2019?


GetForCurrentThread
Yes


CreateTimer
Yes


TryEnqueue
Yes


ShutdownStaring
Yes


ShutdownCompleted
Yes


HasThreadAccess
No



It occurred to me that you can see if a particular Dispatcher­Queue belongs to the current thread by simply reversing the question: Ask the current thread for its Dispatcher­Queue and see if it’s the one you were given. This relies on the fact that each thread can have at most one Dispatcher­Queue.
// Alternate version that simulates HasThreadAccess
// on Windows Server 2019.

// C++/WinRT
bool DispatcherQueueHasThreadAccess(DispatcherQueue const& q)
{
    ASSERT(q != nullptr); // caller should have checked this first
    return q == DispatcherQueue::GetForCurrentThread();
}

The customer reported back that it worked great.
A lot of computer programming is just looking at the tools you have available in your toolbox and seeing whether you can combine them in an interesting way to accomplish your goal.
