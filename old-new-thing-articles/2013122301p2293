         I dreamed that I was back in college taking a course in South Frisian, but I suspected something was up because the words didnâ€™t sound Germanic at all, and we were taught the words to a Christmas carol as Nom Yom Hear What I Hear? 
 Also, because the course was taught by  known prevaricator/exaggerator Robert Irvine.
