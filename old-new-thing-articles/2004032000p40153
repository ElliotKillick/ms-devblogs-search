        Something is wrong with the world when fark finds something “real” news organizations miss. (When I first learned about fark, I confused it with FARC, a different organization entirely. That’s right, a terrorist organization has its own official web site. Gotta love the Internet.)
Anyway, fark has pointed out that the guy that Pakistani forces claim today to have surrounded along the border with Afghanistan, Ayman al-Zawahiri, was already reported to have been captured two years ago by The Grauniad. They never printed a correction (as far as I can tell) so I guess he cloned himself.
