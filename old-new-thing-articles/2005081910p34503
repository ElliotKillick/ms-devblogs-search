         Everybody’s lunchtime conversation a few days ago was the  riot at a used laptop sale in Richmond, VA. [Local coverage.] What got me was this fellow Jesse Sandler: 

 “I took my chair here and I threw it over my shoulder and I went, ‘Bam,'” the 20-year-old said nonchalantly, his eyes glued to the screen of his new iBook, as he tapped away on the keyboard at a testing station. 
 “They were getting in front of me and I was there a lot earlier than them, so I thought that it was just,” he said. 

 Because if somebody cuts in front of you in line, you are perfectly justified in assaulting them with a folding chair. That’s one of the guiding principles this country was founded on.
