         Miscellaneous notes, largely unorganized. 

A lot of people questioned the specific choice of          MOV EDI, EDI as the two-byte NOP,     with many people suggesting alternatives.     The decision to use MOV EDI, EDI as the two-byte NOP     instruction came after consulting with CPU manufacturers for     their recommendations for the best two-byte NOP.     So if you think something better should have been used,     go take it up with the CPU manufacturers.     They’re the ones who came up with the recommendation.     (Though I suspect they know more about the best way to optimize     code for their CPUs than you do.) 
     You can enable hotpatching on your own binaries by          passing the /hotpatch flag to the compiler. 
     The primary audience for hotpatching is server administrators     who want to          install a security update without having to reboot the computer. 
There were some people who interpreted the presence of hotpatch     points as a security hole, since it makes it easier for malware     to redirect OS code.     Well, yes, but it didn’t enable     anything that they didn’t already know how to do.     If malware can patch your process,     then it has already made it     to the other side of the airtight hatchway.     And besides, malware authors aren’t going to bother carefully     patching code to avoid obscure race conditions.     They’re just going to patch the first five bytes     of the function without regard for safety,     because that’ll work 99% of the time.     (It’s not like the other 1% are going to call the virus     authors when the patch fails.)
