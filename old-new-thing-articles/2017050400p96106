        A customer had a question about the interaction between Application Desktop Toolbars (commonly known as AppBars) and Windows 10 virtual desktops. “When we create our AppBar, it is shown on all virtual desktops. Is this expected behavior? Can I limit it to only one virtual desktop?” 
Yes, this is expected behavior. AppBars modify the work area of the monitor they appear on, and the work area is global across all virtual desktops. As a result, AppBars are also global across all virtual desktops.
