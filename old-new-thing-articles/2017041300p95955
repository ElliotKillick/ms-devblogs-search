        A customer reported that their program locks up once or twice each day. They took a full dump of the file while it was hung and asked windbg to analyze it. Here’s a redacted version of what it said: 

PRIMARY_PROBLEM_CLASS: APPLICATION_HANG_BusyHang

STACK_TEXT:  
msvcr80!_memcpy+0x7d
contoso!Buffer::Compact+0x3d
contoso!BufferReader::Parse+0x14c
contoso!handle_widget_message+0x37
contoso!handle_input+0x12f
contoso!dispatch_event+0x27
contoso!handle_events+0xbe

The Buffer::Compact method shifts some memory around inside the buffer: 

void Buffer::Compact()
{
  if (m_bytesRead > 0) {
    memmove(m_buffer, m_buffer + m_bytesRead, m_capacity - m_bytesRead);
    m_capacity -= m_bytesRead;
    m_bytesRead = 0;
  }
}

“Is it possible that memmove has a busy wait? What could it be waiting for?” 
The memmove function doesn’t have a busy loop where it waits for something. It just moves the memory from one location to another. 
What’s probably happening is that there is a busy loop higher up the stack. Maybe  Buffer­Reader::Parse has gotten into a loop, or (my guess) handle_events is stuck in a loop processing a huge number of incoming events. 
When you take the memory dump, you are capturing the program at a moment in time. All you know is that the thread is probably in a busy wait, but the source of the busy wait need not be the thing at the top of the stack. 
If memcpy is consistently at the top of the stack, then it means that the thread is spending most of its time copying memory. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that memcpy is stuck in a loop. The more likely reason is that the thread is busy doing some larger operation, and that larger operation entails a lot of memcpy operations. 
Though in extreme edge cases it might be a busy loop. 
Sort-of related. 
Exercise: The customer’s code calls memmove, so why is the memcpy function the one at the top of the stack? What happened to memmove?
