         Actually, this is pretty cool. A phone that sets your head on fire. Most people charge extra for that. 
 These lithium-ion polymer batteries can overheat due to an internal short circuit in the batteries, which can pose a fire hazard.  The battery has only been used in the GN9120 wireless headset. 
 Go ahead, make up your own joke.
