         You can buy a fake vacation for $500 or shell out $300 to $400 for a fake brawl at your wedding. 
 “If you read any book about traditional weddings in Russian history, there must be a fight,” said Alexander Yermilov, 22, who recently made a living at it. 
  If you’re looking for counterfeits, fakes, and forgeries, Moscow’s your place. Assuming you can spot them. 

 Even Putin’s doctoral dissertation, researchers from the Brookings Institution revealed this year, contained major sections lifted from a text published by academics from the University of Pittsburgh. 
 The revelations barely were repeated in the Moscow press, not because they were scandalous, but because they weren’t—government officials routinely rely on fake dissertations patched together by underlings.
