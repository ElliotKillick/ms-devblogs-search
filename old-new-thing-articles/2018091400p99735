        Inside the Zune HD case is engraved the message For our Princess. 
The message is a tribute to an administrative assistant on the Zune team who passed away during development of the project. 
She gained the nickname Princess from a group she worked in before joining the Zune team. Another administrative assistant on the team dubbed herself Queen of Everything. In response, she became the Princess of Everything Else.
