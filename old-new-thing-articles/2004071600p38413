You’ve all seen those ugly boxes.  When you try to display a string
and the font you have doesn’t support all of the characters in it,
you get an ugly box for the characters that aren’t available in the
font.


Start with

our scratch program and add this to the
PaintContent function:


void
PaintContent(HWND hwnd, PAINTSTRUCT *pps)
{
    TextOutW(pps->hdc, 0, 0,
            L"ABC\x0410\x0411\x0412\x0E01\x0E02\x0E03", 9);
}


That string contains the first three letters from
three different alphabets: “ABC” from the Roman alphabet;
“АБВ”
from the Cyrillic alphabet; and
“กขฃ” from the Thai alphabet.


If you run this program, you get a bunch of ugly boxes for the
non-Roman characters because the SYSTEM font is very limited in
its character set support.


But how to pick the right font?  What if the string contained
Korean or Japanese characters?  There is no single font that
contains every character defined by Unicode. (Or at least,
none that is commonly available.)  What do you do?


This is where

font linking comes in.


Font linking allows you to take a string and break it into
pieces, where each piece can be displayed in an appropriate font.



The IMLangFontLink2 interface provides the methods necessary
to do this breaking.

GetStrCodePages takes the string apart into chunks, such that
all the characters in a chunk
can be displayed by the same font, and

MapFont creates the font.


Okay, so let’s write our font-link-enabled version of the
TextOut function.  We’ll do this in stages,
starting with the
idea kernel.


#include <mlang.h>
HRESULT TextOutFL(HDC hdc, int x, int y, LPCWSTR psz, int cch)
{
  ...
  while (cch > 0) {
    DWORD dwActualCodePages;
    long cchActual;
    pfl->GetStrCodePages(psz, cch, 0, &dwActualCodePages, &cchActual);
    HFONT hfLinked;
    pfl->MapFont(hdc, dwActualCodePages, 0, &hfLinked);
    HFONT hfOrig = SelectFont(hdc, hfLinked);
    TextOut(hdc, ?, ?, psz, cchActual);
    SelectFont(hdc, hfOrig);
    pfl->ReleaseFont(hfLinked);
    psz += cchActual;
    cch -= cchActual;
  }
  ...
}


After figuring out which code pages the default font supports,
we walk through the string asking GetStrCodePages to give us
the next chunk of characters. From that chunk, we create a matching font
and draw the characters in that font at “the right place”.
Repeat until all the characters
are done.


The rest is refinement and paperwork.


First of all, what is “the right place”?
We want the next chunk to resume where the previous chunk left off.
For that, we take advantage of the TA_UPDATECP text alignment style,
which says that GDI should draw the text at the current position,
and update the current position to the end of the drawn text
(therefore, in position for the next chunk).


Therefore, part of the paperwork is to set the DC’s current position
and set the text mode to TA_UPDATECP:

  SetTextAlign(hdc, GetTextAlign(hdc) | TA_UPDATECP);
  MoveToEx(hdc, x, y, NULL);


Then we can just pass “0,0” as the coordinates to TextOut,
because the coordinates passed to TextOut are ignored if
the text alignment mode is TA_UPDATECP;
it always draws at the current position.


Of course, we can’t just mess with the DC’s settings like this.
If the caller did not set TA_UPDATECP, then the caller
is not expecting us to be meddling with the current
position.  Therefore, we have to save the original position
and restore it (and the original text alignment mode) afterwards.


  POINT ptOrig;
  DWORD dwAlignOrig = GetTextAlign(hdc);
  SetTextAlign(hdc, dwAlignOrig | TA_UPDATECP);
  MoveToEx(hdc, x, y, &ptOrig);
  while (cch > 0) {
    ...
    TextOut(hdc, 0, 0, psz, cchActual);
    ...
  }
  // if caller did not want CP updated, then restore it
  // and restore the text alignment mode too
  if (!(dwAlignOrig & TA_UPDATECP)) {
    SetTextAlign(hdc, dwAlignOrig);
    MoveToEx(hdc, ptOrig.x, ptOrig.y, NULL);
  }


Next is a refinement:
We should take advantage of the second parameter to
GetStrCodePages, which specifies the code pages we would prefer to use
if a choice is avialable.
Clearly we should prefer to use the code pages supported by the font
we want to use, so that if the character can be displayed in that font
directly, then we shouldn’t map an alternate font.


  HFONT hfOrig = (HFONT)GetCurrentObject(hdc, OBJ_FONT);
  DWORD dwFontCodePages = 0;
  pfl->GetFontCodePages(hdc, hfOrig, &dwFontCodePages);
  ...
  while (cch > 0) {
    pfl->GetStrCodePages(psz, cch, dwFontCodePages, &dwActualCodePages, &cchActual);
    if (dwActualCodePages & dwFontCodePages) {
      // our font can handle it - draw directly using our font
      TextOut(hdc, 0, 0, psz, cchActual);
    } else {
      ... MapFont etc ...
    }
  }
  ...


Of course, you probably wonder this magical pfl comes
from.  It comes from

the Multilanguage Object in mlang.

  IMLangFontLink2 *pfl;
  CoCreateInstance(CLSID_CMultiLanguage, NULL,
                   CLSCTX_ALL, IID_IMLangFontLink2, (void**)&pfl);
  ...
  pfl->Release();


And of course, all the errors we’ve been ignoring need to be taken care of.
This does create a big of a problem if we run into an error after we have
already made it through a few chunks.  What should we do?


I’m going to handle the error by drawing the string in the original font,
ugly boxes and all.  We can’t erase the characters we already drew,
and we can’t just draw half of the string (for our caller won’t know where
to resume).
So we just draw with the original font and hope for the best.
At least it’s no worse than it was before font linking.


Put all of these refinements together and you get this final function:


HRESULT TextOutFL(HDC hdc, int x, int y, LPCWSTR psz, int cch)
{
  HRESULT hr;
  IMLangFontLink2 *pfl;
  if (SUCCEEDED(hr = CoCreateInstance(CLSID_CMultiLanguage, NULL,
                      CLSCTX_ALL, IID_IMLangFontLink2, (void**)&pfl))) {
    HFONT hfOrig = (HFONT)GetCurrentObject(hdc, OBJ_FONT);
    POINT ptOrig;
    DWORD dwAlignOrig = GetTextAlign(hdc);
    if (!(dwAlignOrig & TA_UPDATECP)) {
      SetTextAlign(hdc, dwAlignOrig | TA_UPDATECP);
    }
    MoveToEx(hdc, x, y, &ptOrig);
    DWORD dwFontCodePages = 0;
    hr = pfl->GetFontCodePages(hdc, hfOrig, &dwFontCodePages);
    if (SUCCEEDED(hr)) {
      while (cch > 0) {
        DWORD dwActualCodePages;
        long cchActual;
        hr = pfl->GetStrCodePages(psz, cch, dwFontCodePages, &dwActualCodePages, &cchActual);
        if (FAILED(hr)) {
          break;
        }
        if (dwActualCodePages & dwFontCodePages) {
          TextOut(hdc, 0, 0, psz, cchActual);
        } else {
          HFONT hfLinked;
          if (FAILED(hr = pfl->MapFont(hdc, dwActualCodePages, 0, &hfLinked))) {
            break;
          }
          SelectFont(hdc, hfLinked);
          TextOut(hdc, 0, 0, psz, cchActual);
          SelectFont(hdc, hfOrig);
          pfl->ReleaseFont(hfLinked);
        }
        psz += cchActual;
        cch -= cchActual;
      }
      if (FAILED(hr)) {
        //  We started outputting characters so we have to finish.
        //  Do the rest without font linking since we have no choice.
        TextOut(hdc, 0, 0, psz, cch);
        hr = S_FALSE;
      }
    }
    pfl->Release();
    if (!(dwAlignOrig & TA_UPDATECP)) {
      SetTextAlign(hdc, dwAlignOrig);
      MoveToEx(hdc, ptOrig.x, ptOrig.y, NULL);
    }
  }
  return hr;
}


Finally, we can wrap the entire operation inside a helper function
that first tries with font linking and if that fails, then just draws
the text the old-fashioned way.


void TextOutTryFL(HDC hdc, int x, int y, LPCWSTR psz, int cch)
{
  if (FAILED(TextOutFL(hdc, x, y, psz, cch)) {
    TextOut(hdc, x, y, psz, cch);
  }
}


Okay, now that we have our font-linked TextOut with fallback,
we can go ahead and adjust our PaintContent function to use it.


void
PaintContent(HWND hwnd, PAINTSTRUCT *pps)
{
  TextOutTryFL(pps->hdc, 0, 0,
               TEXT("ABC\x0410\x0411\x0412\x0E01\x0E02\x0E03"), 9);
}


Observe that the string is now displayed with no black boxes.


One refinement I did not do was to avoid creating the
IMlangFontLink2 pointer each time we want to draw text.
In a “real program” you would probably create the multilanguage
object once per drawing context (per window, perhaps) and re-use it
to avoid going through the whole object creation codepath each time
you want to draw a string.
