         Jeremy Mazner has asked me to put together a  400-level session at this year’s  PDC. I came up with the title “Five(ish) things every Win32 developer should know (but likely doesn’t)”. Of course, now I have to think of five things! Here are some ideas I’ve been kicking around.

The memory scene:     Physical address space != physical memory != virtual memory !=     virtual address space 
Consequences of the way CPUs work:     How my O(n) algorithm can run circles around your O(log n) algorithm;     why much of what you learned in school simply doesn’t matter 
Parent vs. owner windows 
Asynchronous input queues, the hazards of attaching thread input,     and how it happens without your knowledge 
Dialog units, DPI and the overloaded term “large fonts” 

 Would you go to a talk that covered these topics? If not, what topics would you rather hear me talk about?
 Follow-up: The talk will be a little over an hour. (And fixed the title. Thanks, Dave.)
