        I know two people (siblings) who are experts at those claw games. They can look at a claw game, assess the situation, decide whether there is a winnable toy, and if so, drop in their quarter and grab it. I asked the elder sibling how they arrived at this amazing skill.
 “As a teenager, I spent something like $20 pumping quarters into one of these machines, and I eventually figured it out.”
 Or there is the  direct approach.
