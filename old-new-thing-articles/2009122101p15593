        Then again, the “no sense of fashion or taste” may be redundant.
 Perhaps you are so enamored of the Microsoft-branded  Snuggie you received  at the Company Meeting that you can’t keep your excitement to yourself and want to share the joy with a friend. No problem. You can now pick one up at the Microsoft Company Store in Redmond, right across the hall from the  Visitor Center. (The Rapture Index ticks up another notch.)
 “You shouldn’t have.”
