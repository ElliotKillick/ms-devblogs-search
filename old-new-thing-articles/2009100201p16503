         Many of my married friends have “other girlfriends”, or at least that’s how their wives tease them. 

Friend 1’s “other girlfriend” is a male colleague with whom     he often goes to dinner when working late. 
Friend 2’s “other girlfriend” is his boat. 
Friend 3’s “other girlfriend” is     a     “regularly changing set of small electronic devices.” 

 I don’t know for certain, but if you ask my wife, she’ll probably say that my “other girlfriend” is this Web site.
