The first onstage round of the Scripps National Spelling Bee takes place today. Best of luck to all entrants! 
Bonus chatter: For many years, the Scripps National Spelling Bee FAQ, did not include the question “When does the spelling bee take place?”¹ As a result, every year, I have to guess when it’s going to take place, and every year I guess wrong and have to push this entry out another year, hoping to guess better next time. For 2017, I submitted a media request, and they told me that the 2017 finals would be on May 30, 31 and June 1. But then I mis-filed this blog entry, and I didn’t find it until after the spelling bee had taken place. I guess in 2018 they got tired of answering the question, so they added it to their FAQ. 
¹ Or maybe nobody asked that question before 2017.
