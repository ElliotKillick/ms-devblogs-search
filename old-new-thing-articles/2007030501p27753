        (Following up on  an earlier entry.) The National Weather Service  chose a name for the wind storm of December 2006: It’s going to be called the “Hanukkah Eve Wind Storm of 2006”.
 But what is Hannukah Eve? Eh, it doesn’t look like anybody’s getting too worked up over that.
 You can  download the entire list of entries (over 5000 of them) from the NOAA web site. They also have  their own discussion of how the contest went.
