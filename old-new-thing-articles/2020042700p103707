        I couldn’t get something to work. The details aren’t important.
I found a very old internal wiki page that listed a long, complicated process for getting the thing to work. I strongly suspected that it wouldn’t help, but out of thoroughness was obligated to give it a try, so that if somebody asked if I tried it, I could say “Yes, and it didn’t work.”
It failed on step 1.
Yay! This is so much better than failing on step 23.
Now I could ask for help with a slightly clearer conscience.
