A customer had a program that decided at runtime
what language to use for its user interface.
The customer was having trouble getting the program’s
dialog boxes to show up with right-to-left layout
when necessary.



We are setting the
WS_EX_LAYOUT­RTL
extended style in the dialog box’s
WM_INIT­DIALOG message handler,
but
what we’re seeing is
that although the style applies successfully,
and the dialog itself renders RTL,
its child elements don’t.

The actual screen shot provided by the customer
involved Arabic text, but I used English text so you
can see which parts are running left-to-right and
which parts are right-to-left.
Also, because I don’t know Arabic.


The title bar is running right-to-left, as desired,
but the contents of the dialog are still left-to-right.
What’s going on?


As I’ve noted before,

the
WS_EX_LAYOUT­RTL
extended style
is inherited by child windows
(unless blocked by the
WS_EX_NO­INHERIT­LAYOUT
extended style).
What I didn’t call out is that this inheritance occurs at the
point the child window is created.
The child window takes a snapshot of its parent window’s
layout;
future changes to the parent window’s layout have no effect.


The next piece of the puzzle is realizing that the
WM_INIT­DIALOG message
is sent after the child windows have been created.

I called this out explicitly in an earlier discussion of dialog boxes,
but you already know this,
because your
WM_INIT­DIALOG message handler
calls
Get­Dlg­Item to obtain handles to dialog
child windows in order to initialize and configure them.


So you need to get the
WS_EX_LAYOUT­RTL
onto the window before child windows are created.
One way of doing this is to edit the dialog template
and add (or remove) the
WS_EX_LAYOUT­RTL
extended style
from the

dwExStyle member of the 32-bit extended header
before you call
Create­Dialog­Indirect or one of its relatives.
