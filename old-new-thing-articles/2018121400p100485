        A customer reported a Windows bug via Feedback Hub. It said that after signing in, they got this mysterious error message:





Error×



LoadLibrary failed with error 87: The parameter is incorrect.



 OK 





The customer included a screen shot but no diagnostic information or process dump files. This is all you get:

You are now in an episode of  CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. The investigator has only a tiny piece of physical evidence and must use it to track down the killer.
Can you solve it?
 
Look closely at the taskbar. The button for the error dialog has an unusual icon.

It’s a camera, which happens to match the camera icon on the desktop for Contoso Camera.
This error dialog didn’t come from Windows. It came from Contoso Camera. The customer can take up the issue with Contoso.
Now, it’s entirely possible that something in Windows changed that caused Contoso Camera to run into problems, but we’ll let the Contoso Camera folks take a crack at the problem first, seeing as they understand their code better than we do.

(function () {
  function update_time() {
    var now = new Date();
    document.getElementById("20181214-date").innerHTML =
      (now.getMonth() + 1) + "/" + now.getDate() + "/" + now.getFullYear();
    var h = now.getHours() % 12 || 12;
    document.getElementById("20181214-time").innerHTML =
      (now.getHours() % 12 || 12) + "\u2236" +
      (now.getMinutes() > 9 ? "" : "0") +
      now.getMinutes() +
      (now.getHours() > 11 ? " PM" : " AM");
  }
  update_time();
  var now = new Date();
  setTimeout(function() {
    update_time();
    setInterval(update_time, 60000);
  }, 60000 - (now.getSeconds() * 1000 + now.getMilliseconds()));
})();
