         The  Lincoln Square mall in Bellevue will have a new tenant: An upscale bowling all^H^H^Hlounge.  Expected to open before the Christmas holiday season, there will be two bars, full-service dining, lots of big plasma screens, all the stuff that makes bowling better. The lounge be positioned on the second floor, beneath  Parlor Billiards, a business which by a fantastic coincidence has exactly the same business model as the bowling all^H^H^Hlounge, but with billiards instead of bowling. By Christmastime, the 23,900 square foot venue will be the site of strikes, splits, and, no doubt, lots of failed  pick-up attempts.
