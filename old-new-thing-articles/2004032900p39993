        There’s some to-do over  a soldier who volunteered  to serve in the army who has since changed his mind and is applying for  conscientous objector status.
  I noticed this trend over two years ago, when    people who had enlisted in the armed forces underwent a change of  heart after the World Trade Center attacks:
  Many of the enlisted personnel who are now seeking honorable  discharges argue they didn’t sign up to defend America; they just  wanted to learn a trade or earn money for college.  
  Sort of like the    Monty Python sketch.
  “Watkins why did you join the army?”  “For the water-skiing and for the travel, sir. And not for the  killing, sir. I asked them to put it on my form, sir – no killing.”
  (I should point out that this particular situation appears to be different,  however, since he did serve the first time he was called.)
