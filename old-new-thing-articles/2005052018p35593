Today, a quick puzzler.


Consider the following code fragment:


 ShowWindow(hwnd, SW_SHOWNORMAL);
 assert(IsWindowVisible(hwnd));


We just showed the window, certainly it is visible, right?
Yet the assertion can fire (even in the absence of multi-threading).  Why?


Answer below – stop reading if you want to try to solve it yourself.


Take a look at

the IsWindowVisible function.


If the specified window, its parent window, its parent’s parent window,
and so forth, have the WS_VISIBLE style,
the return value is nonzero. Otherwise, the return value is zero.


The WS_VISIBLE style indicates that this window is
visible in its parent.  But the parent itself might not be visible,
in which case IsWindowVisible returns FALSE.
