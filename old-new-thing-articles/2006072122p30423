        I guess they’re not doing a particularly good job of creating awareness because it wasn’t until I consulted  the 2006 National Health Observances calendar that the month of July is International Group B Strep Awareness Month.
 For some reason, July and August are pretty light on the health observances calendar. Maybe because people are on summer vacation.
 Who decides whether a particular health observance merits a day, a week, or a month? You’d think they’d save the months for the really big issues, seeing as there are only twelve of them. And for some reason, ultraviolet radiation gets two months. May is Ultraviolet Awareness Month, and July is UV Safety Month. That’s one sixth of the year dedicated to ultraviolet radiation.
 (I’m not belittling the health causes themselves, just the way they get assigned days on the calendar.)
