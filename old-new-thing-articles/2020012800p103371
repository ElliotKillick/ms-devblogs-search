        The debugger that comes with Debugging Tools for Windows goes by the name WinDbg, short for Windows Debugger, and generally pronounced win-debug or win-dee-bee-gee. Itâ€™s part of a suite of lightweight debuggers, along with ntsd (short for NT Symbolic Debugger) and cdb (Console Debugger), which are all based on the same debugging engine, creatively named DbgEng.
However, the question was how I pronounce it, and I pronounce it the same way as many other old-timers: We call it windbag.
