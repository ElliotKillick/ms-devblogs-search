         Okay, maybe this time I’m misreading it on purpose, but when I see the name of popular new restaurant  Local 360, I think, “That doesn’t look all that low-calorie to me. I bet their dishes have more than 360 calories.” 
 Or maybe it’s “We serve high-calorie foods five days a year. Congratulations, you happen to have picked those five days.”
