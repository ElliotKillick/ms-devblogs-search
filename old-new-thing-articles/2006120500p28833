You already know how to do this,
you just don’t realize it.


How do you find files with an “x” in their name?
That’s right, you use dir *x*.


Now you just have to change that x to a space.
And since spaces are command line delimiters, you need to quote
the sequence so it gets treated as a single parameter
rather than two “*” parameters:


dir "* *"


Stick in a /s if you want to search recursively.
