        I ordered some tickets online and was sent to a Web page which displayed the tickets (with bar codes and stuff), with instructions to print them out. 
The Web page also had this big warning on it: 
IT IS UNLAWFUL TO REPRODUCE THIS TICKET IN ANY FORM. 
Um, this is a print-at-home ticket. The entire reason for its existence is to be reproduced in printed form. 
I printed it anyway. 
Nobody arrested me.
