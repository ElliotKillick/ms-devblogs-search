         Even though I’m signed in, the page claims that anonymous comments are not allowed, so I’m reduced to posting my comment here and generating a trackback.  Some time ago, Robert McLaws wrote a function that generates initials from a name. Let’s set aside completely the issue of non-U.S. names; the function doesn’t even handle U.S. names correctly. 
 Given Cal Ripken, Jr., the function comes up with the initials JCR, which is decidedly suboptimal.
