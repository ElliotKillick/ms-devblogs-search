        Sometimes you’ll see somebody brag about how many words are  in their spell-checking dictionary.  It turns out that having too many words in a spell checker’s dictionary  is worse than having too few.
  Suppose you had a spell checker whose  dictionary contained every word in the  Oxford English Dictionary.  Then you hand it this sentence:
  Therf werre eyght bokes.  
  That sentence would pass with flying colors, because all of the  words in the above sentence are valid English words, though  most people would be hard-pressed to provide definitions.
  The English language has so many words that if you included them all,  then common typographical errors would often match (by coincidence)  a valid English word and therefore not be detected by the spell checker.  Which would go against the whole point of a spell checker: To catch  spelling errors.
  So be glad that your spell checker doesn’t have the largest dictionary  possible.  If it did, it would end up doing a worse job.
  After I wrote this article, I found    a nice discussion of the subject of spell check dictionary size  on the Wintertree Software web site.
