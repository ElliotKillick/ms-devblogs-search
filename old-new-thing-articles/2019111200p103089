        Here’s how you copy or move a group of files into a new folder.

Select the files and folders you want to copy or move.
Click the Move to or Copy to button, corresponding to what you want to do.
In the flyout, click Choose location… at the bottom.
Go to where you want the new folder to be created and click the Make New Folder button.
Give your new folder a name.
Select your new folder and say OK.

Bonus shortcut: Right-click the files and folders, then go to Send to and say Compressed (zip) folder. This creates a new ZIP file from the files and folders you selected. I use this shortcut a lot.
