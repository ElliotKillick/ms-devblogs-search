             A     British scientific study shows that a bit of classical music can persuade diners to     buy more fancy coffees, pricey wines and luxurious desserts. “North has shown     that playing German or French music can persuade diners to buy wine from those countries.”     I found this to be true in my experience. If you get two thousand people in a tent     and play live oom-pah music, they end up drinking lots of German beer.
