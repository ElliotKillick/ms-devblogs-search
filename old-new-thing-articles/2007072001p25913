        One of the little cards that came in the STP information packet is an advertisement postcard for  Epic Cycling Climbs of France. For $3299 (+airfare) you receive the “privilege” of cycling up the Alpe d’Huez and other notorious mountains.
 I’m sorry. If I’m going to go up l’Alpe D’Huez you’re going to have to pay me, not the other way around.
 (Then again, I paid to ride my bicycle from Seattle to Portland, so obviously I’m a little insane already. I’ve already taken the first steps in  progressive insanity; maybe they were just showing me where I was headed if I didn’t watch my step. Sort of like those anti-smoking ads.)
