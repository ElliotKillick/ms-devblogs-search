         Here are a collection of brief messages not worthy of a full blog entry. I think I’m going to call it macro-tweeting. 

Went to pick up my new suit, only to discover that instead     of altering it, the store returned the suit to inventory.     

@raymond: Customer service fail!     
@raymond: Hey, at least they didn’t charge you a restocking fee!     
@ian: Got re-fitted. Clerk: “How do I ring this up?”         Salesman: “You don’t. He already paid for it.”     


Silver lining:     Found my long-lost camera recharger while organizing documents     for my IRS compliance examination. 
Current record against Chilly Hilly: 2 wins, 1 loss. 
Learned another Chinese word. Only 2960 to go.     Should be ready for basic conversation around 2097. 
Unpacking a blender.     

@raymond: Makin’ smoothies, eh?     


Less impressed with friend’s 10,000-BTU hotpot burner,     now that I found the sticker on my own El Lame-O burner     that reads 9,925. 
Got schooled in dumpling-making. 
If, at the dinner table, a four-year-old offers to play     the game Guess what’s in my mouth, you should decline.
