        You’ve seen it, I’m sure. People walking down the street talking to themselves.  Crazy or cellphone?
 What really gets me are the people who  wear the headsets even when they aren’t talking on the telephone, but rather in anticipation of receiving a telephone call. To those people, I have this to say to you: 
 You’re not that important.  Get over yourself. 
 I remember a few years ago, I was in Los Angeles attending a little party and got a ride home from somebody who was heading my way. We got in the car, and she put on her headset before putting the car in gear. It was a half-hour drive. No telephone call.
