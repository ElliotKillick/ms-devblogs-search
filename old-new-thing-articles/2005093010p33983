        Back in 1995, I was participating in a chat room on MSN on the subject of device driver development. One of the people in the chat room asked, “Can I write a device driver in Visual Basic?”
 I replied, “Windows 95 device drivers are typically written in low-level languages such as C or even assembly language.” 
 Undaunted, the person clarified: “But I have Visual Basic Professional.”
