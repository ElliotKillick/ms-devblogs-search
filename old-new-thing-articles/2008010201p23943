        In case you missed it, a former Seattle police detective was arrested in early 2007 for driving with  a state record high blood-alcohol level of 0.47 percent. (The legal limit is 0.08 percent, most people black out at 0.35 percent, and  0.40 percent is lethal for 50% of adults.) She was subsequently  arrested and held on $250,000 bail (story contains other history of Ms. Jarrett). Bail was  increased to $300,000 a week later, with another hearing scheduled for May for… a separate DUI case.  At the May hearing, the initial attempt by the driver’s attorneys to release their client to a treatment center failed, but  a second attempt succeeded (second story).
 And then that’s it. No more news I can find. I suspect we’ll never learn whether the treatment program was deemed a success.
 Just as that saga appears to be winding down, a new one appears to be starting up: In neighbor state Oregon, a person with multiple drunken driving convictions was discovered with  a blood alcohol level of a stunning 0.55 percent.
