        Commenter kero points out that Windows 95 supported a flag called TPM_SYS­MENU, but Windows NT doesn’t. Why not? 
The TPM_SYS­MENU was never documented. It was used internally by Windows 95 for something-or-other, but Windows NT didn’t need to support it, so it didn’t. Since it was an internal flag that was never documented, the Windows NT team were under no obligation to support it, and they chose not to. After all, why go to the extra work of writing code to support a flag that nobody can legitimately be using? 
Unsupported flag is unsupported.
