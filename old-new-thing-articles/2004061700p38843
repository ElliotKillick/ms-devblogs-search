        Last year there was    a recall of exploding frying pans.  For some reason I found this funny.
  “The pans can explode or separate when preheated,  used on high heat or used for frying,”  the safety commission said in a statement.  
  It explodes when you  fry something in it.
  Apparently “frying stuff” was not in the test plan for the frying pans.
