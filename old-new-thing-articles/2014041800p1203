If you use one of the command line debuggers based on the

Debugger Engine,
you can set a breakpoint on a function whose name contains spaces
or other special characters by quoting the symbol name.
The trick here is that you do not quote the entire string;
you quote only the symbol name.


0:001> bu @!"CSimpleArray<wchar_t *>::CSimpleArray<wchar_t *>"


Note that the quotation marks do not go around the @!
part.
They go only around the symbol.
(Otherwise, the debugger thinks you are setting a breakpoint
action.)


Another trick for setting breakpoints is using tab autocompletion
for symbols. If you type
bp contoso!*Widget* and then hit Tab repeatedly,
you will cycle through all the matches.
(It takes a few seconds to build the list of matches, so be patient
the first time you hit Tab.)


Personally, I use the x command to print out all the
matches, and then cherry-pick the one I want.


0:001> x contoso!*Widget*
00af114c contoso!CreateWidget
009fe863 contoso!DestroyWidget
00a2e161 contoso!MakeWidgetReadOnly
00a93168 ...
0:001> bp 00a2e161     set breakpoint on MakeWidgetReadOnly
