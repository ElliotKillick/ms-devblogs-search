         In 2010, a group of scam artists  pretended that they were making a film, appropriately titled A Landscape of Lies. They did this so that they could claim over £2.7 million in tax credits intended to boost the British film industry. Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs began to suspect something was up when no apparent progress was being made on the project and  the film company’s “office” was an empty room. The scammers tried to make the project look legitimate by  actually making a movie for  £84,000 and releasing it on DVD. (You can watch the trailer here.) The fake movie was convincing enough to trick one film festival into giving it an award (which it later had to  take back.)
