        A question was sent to an internal discussion list for users of the XYZ tool:
 From: Q To: XYZ Users  The GHI function in the JKL tool doesn’t work for me. «description of problem deleted» 

 I responded with this message:
 To: Q, XYZ Users  The JKL tool is not part of XYZ. You should contact the author of the JKL tool. 

 The reason why people were amused by this is that the author of the JKL tool is me. (Says so right there in the online help.)
 As a final punch line, the person never did contact me.
