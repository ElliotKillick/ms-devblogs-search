        I observed one of my colleagues perform this trick with cmd.exe: You can pass a path with forward slashes (instead of backslashes) to the cd command, provided the first character is not a slash. 

cd relative/path       &rem okay
cd ../relative/path    &rem okay
cd /absolute/path      &rem not okay
cd c:/absolute/path    &rem okay

Itâ€™s not much of a trick, but it comes handy once in a while.
