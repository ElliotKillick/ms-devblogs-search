        You probably know them already, but if you’re new to Win32, here are some key window messages. I would normally suggest that you commit them to memory, but if you do enough debugging, you’ll end up memorizing them anyway because you see them all the time.


0x000F 
WM_PAINT


0x001A 
WM_WININICHANGE / WM_SETTINGCHANGE


0x0046 
WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGING


0x0047 
WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGED


0x004E 
WM_NOTIFY


0x010n 
WM_KEYxxx


0x0111 
WM_COMMAND


0x0112 
WM_SYSCOMMAND


0x0113 
WM_TIMER


0x0200 
WM_MOUSEMOVE


0x020n 
WM_MOUSExxx


0x0400 
WM_USER


0x8000 
WM_APP


0xCxxx 
RegisterWindowMessage


 I include 0x001A in the list even though it is a low-traffic message because you do see it a lot when you are investigating hangs. The WM_SETTINGCHANGE (which also goes by the name WM_WININICHANGE) is a common culprit when investigating why your program has wedged: You’re broadcasting a notification and there’s a window in the system that isn’t responding.
 I know that Visual Studio has  a shortcut for decoding error codes. I wonder if it has one for decoding message numbers.
