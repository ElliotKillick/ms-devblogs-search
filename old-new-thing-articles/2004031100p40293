        The skater you love to hate is back.
    Tonya Harding will lace up for a single game tomorrow with the  Indianapolis Ice, which coincidentally happens to be  “Guaranteed Fight Night”.  (If there’s no fight, you get a free ticket to another game.)
    Ah, minor-league hockey…
  Personally, I don’t think it’s right when somebody  benefits from  having    done something wrong.
