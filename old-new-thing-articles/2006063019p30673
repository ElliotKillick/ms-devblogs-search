         Assuming everything went according to plan, Montréal today  made the final payment on  Olympic Stadium (or Le Stade Olympique), originally built for the 1976 Olympic Games, and nicknamed “The Big O” (or “The Big Owe”, if you prefer). Before you snicker, at least you have to give them credit for keeping the stadium until it was paid off. The Seattle Kingdome opened just a few months before Montréal’s Olympic Stadium, but we  demolished it in 2000 even though we will still be paying for it until 2012.
