         Some of my colleagues were struck by a sentence in  this old Newsweek article about Microsoft’s advertising campaign from last year. The sentence wasn’t about the ad campaign, though. It was about Windows 7: 
 The user interface has a slick new feature, a “taskbar” at the bottom that shows what apps you have open. The new system is due out later this year. 
 Wow, Windows 7 has a “taskbar”.  If only we had thought of that sooner.
