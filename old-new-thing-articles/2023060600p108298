        By default, newly-created wireless networking profiles are made visible to all users. I’m guessing that the idea is that if you connect to a Wi-Fi network, you are setting it up for the entire machine. That way, other users on the same computer can use the same wireless network.
If you don’t like this, you can change the  allow­Everyone­To­Create­All­User­Profiles group policy setting to false. When set to false, only users with  wlan_secure_add_user_all_user_profiles permission can create system-wide profiles. That permission is granted by default to Administrators, but you can customize that by calling Wlan­Set­Security­Settings with your custom access list.
Bonus chatter: Note that being in the all users profile means that anyone can see the password. My guess is that this is the main reason for setting allow­Everyone­To­Create­All­User­Profiles to false.
