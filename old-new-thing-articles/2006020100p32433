         The  marriage of convenience is alive and well, not that is really a surprise to anybody. I found interesting this story on how  some young members of the US military are getting married for purely economic reasons. 
 By getting married, he would get a housing stipend and permission to move off-base. And as his legal wife, she would get health coverage and a cut of his extra money.
