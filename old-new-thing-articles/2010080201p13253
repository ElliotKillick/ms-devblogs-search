        Many years ago, one of my colleagues (who happens to be an avid outdoorsy person with a dry sense of humor) assembled a small group of people to take a long weekend hike  along the Capa Alava Trail and then  north along the Pacific coast. As we gathered in the parking lot midday Friday with our backpacking gear, another of our colleagues (whom I will call “Mary”) walked past and the following conversation ensued:
 Mary: “Hey, where ya goin’? (joking) That way I can call Search and Rescue if I don’t see you on Monday.”
 Bob: “We’re heading out to Lake Ozette.”
 Mary: “Cool, where’s Lake Ozette?”
 Bob: “That’s okay, Search and Rescue knows where it is.”
