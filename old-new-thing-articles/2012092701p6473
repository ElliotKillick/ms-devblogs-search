        An acquaintance of mine remarked that he sold his bicycle in Seattle a few months ago to some guy who explained, “I’m going to ride it to South America.”
 “Okay,” my acquaintance said, probably with some degree of skepticism.
 But it’s  a real project, and they head out soon! 
Ride to Rio
: Four riders who “share a thirst for being stupid and finding adventure” bicycling through twelve countries and finishing in Rio with very sore butts.
