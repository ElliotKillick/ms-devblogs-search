        This weekend, I attended an Oscar-watching party, and when the clips from the nominees for Live Action Short Film were run, I was completely won over by  West Bank Story. Five seconds of dancing, finger-snapping Jews and Arabs is all I needed.
 When filling out your Oscar party ballot, “Live Action Short Film” is one of those categories you just close your eyes and pick randomly since you don’t know anything about any of the movies. It felt like everybody else at the party felt the same way I did: If we had seen that clip, we would all have voted for it. In our minds, it won the award before the envelope was even torn open.
 Update:  Interview with Ari Sandel, director and co-writer.
