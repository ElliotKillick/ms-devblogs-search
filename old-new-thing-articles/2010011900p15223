        Many years ago, I happened to have lunch with one of the programmers who worked on the video game  Monty Python’s Complete Waste of Time (read a review). This program was notable in many ways, most geekily that it was brought on board the Mir space station by astronaut  Michael Foale.
 Anyway, during the course of lunch, I learned something unusual:
 “The hardest part of writing that program? Synchronizing the farts [sounds] to the video.”
