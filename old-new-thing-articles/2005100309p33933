         Sure,  I like saying “withered hand”, but Google took this a bit too far and made me  the top hit for the phrase withered hand, making me  more popular than Jesus with respect to that phrase, at least for now. I apologize to all the people looking for the  Miracle of the Withered Hand. Fortunately,  MSN Search and  Yahoo were not fooled.
