         Back in 1993, there was an internal presentation discussing the various new features that were being added to that fancy new version of Windows that ultimately came to be known as Windows 95. In the GDI section, one of the new features was listed as “Enchanced metafiles“. 
 When the slide went up, you could hear the scattered titters of laughter as each person read and discovered the typographical error. For a few days thereafter, the GDI folks had to endure people stopping by and asking them, “Hey, so how are those enchanced metafiles coming?”
