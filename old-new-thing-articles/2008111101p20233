         Where there are sneaker addicts you will have sneaker speculators. And not all the sneakerheads appreciate it. 

 Such trading bothers purists like Raymond Chen, 26. 
 “People used to buy sneakers because they love them,” Chen said. “Now it’s like people buy sneakers to make money out of them.” 
 Chen, an engineer from Shoreline, owns about 120 pairs of sneakers and spends about $100 a month on his hobby. If there are a number of shoes releasing within the same month, he spends more.
