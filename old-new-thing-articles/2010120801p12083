        When my niece was in kindergarten, a regular classroom assignment was for students to write a few sentences about something happening in their lives. For one of the assignments, my niece wrote the following:
 My auntie has a baby in her tumy. If it is a boy I will call him Kevin. If it is a grl I will call her Alula. 
 We have no idea where the name “Alula” came from.
 The baby turned out to be a girl, but her aunt chose a different name.
 My niece did not hold up her end of the bargain and call her new cousin “Alula”.
 Update: Upon further reflection, I think the proposed boy’s name was “Derik”, not Kevin. Not important to the story, but included for completeness.
