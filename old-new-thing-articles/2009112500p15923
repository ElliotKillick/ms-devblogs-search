Win32 doesn’t expose a process’s command line to other processes.
From Win32’s point of view, the command line is just a

conveniently
initialized parameter to the process’s startup code,
some data copied from the launching process to the new process
and forgotten.
We’ll get back to the Win32 point of view a little later.


If you look around in WMI, you’ll find a
Win32_Process object, and lo and behold,
it has a CommandLine property.
Let’s check it out,
using the

standard WMI application:


strComputer = "."
Set objWMIService = GetObject("winmgmts:\\" & strComputer & "\root\cimv2")
Set colItems = objWMIService.ExecQuery("Select * from Win32_Process")
For Each objItem in colItems
     Wscript.Echo objItem.Name
     Wscript.Echo objItem.CommandLine
Next


I fully anticipate that half of my readers will stop right there.
“Thanks for the script. Bye!”
And they won’t bother reading the analysis.
“Because analysis is boring,
and it’ll just tell me stuff I don’t want to hear.
The analysis is going to tell me why this won’t work,
or why it’s a bad idea,
and that just cramps my style.”


Remember that from Win32’s point of view,
the command line is
just a string that is copied into the address space of the new process.
How the launching process and the new process interpret this string
is governed

not by rules but by convention.


What’s more, since the string is merely a “preinitialized variable”,
a process could in principle (and many do in practice,
although usually inadvertently) write to the memory that holds the
command line, in which case, if you go snooping around for it,
you’ll see the modified command line.
There is no secret hiding place where the kernel keeps
the “real original command line,”
any more than there is a secret hiding place where the C compiler
keeps the “real original parameters to a function.”


This is just another manifestation of the principle of

not keeping track of information you don’t need.


What does this mean for people who disregard this principle and
go after the command line of another process?
You have to understand what you are getting is non-authoritative
information.
In fact, it’s worse.
It’s information the application itself may have changed
in order to try to fool you,
so don’t use it to make important decisions.
