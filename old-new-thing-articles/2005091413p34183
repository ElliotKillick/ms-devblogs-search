         You can find the following typographical errors in the Big Room at the PDC: 

Intergrated 
Precison 
Personel 

 If you can locate all three of them and catch me at the PDC (say at the Fundamentals Lounge or at the Ask the Experts table), Iâ€™ll award you a prize of um (rummaging through my bag) how about a retractable network cable? (Or an autographed business card? But then again, anybody can get one of those just by asking for one.)
