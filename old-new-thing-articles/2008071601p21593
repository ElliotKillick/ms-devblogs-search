         In what I’m sure is a fantastic surprise to everybody who has visited the Internet, according to  a report in the New York Times, researchers at  Columbia University have discovered that  there are prescription drug pushers on the Internet who will sell you prescription drugs without a prescription. 
 From what I can gather, they didn’t actually check whether what they ordered were indeed what the sites purported the substances to be (although  thanks are extended to MasterCard, Visa, American Express and PayPal for their assistance, which means that they did investigate whether the major online payment systems can be used to purchase the drugs). So who knows, maybe the sites were selling fakes. In other words, maybe the issue isn’t so much one of readily-accessible prescription drugs but rather one of fraud.
