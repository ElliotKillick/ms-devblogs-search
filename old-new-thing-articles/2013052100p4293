         On an internal mailing list about home maintenance and ownership, somebody asked: 

 I have a handful of items that I need to get rid of and probably should not toss into the regular garbage. Any thoughts? 

Older TV — 32″ 
Propane tanks (full) 
Lighter fluid 
Carpet glue adhesive 
Lawn fertilizer 


 The best reply was an unhelpful one. 

 You’ve pretty much got all the components you need to build a bomb. Why dispose of them?
