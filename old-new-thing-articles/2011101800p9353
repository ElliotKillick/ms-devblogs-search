         On   the mailing list with a negative service level agreement, one of my colleagues posted the message 
 Free Nerf guns in my office. I’ve decided I’m no longer a collector. 
 Not one to miss the opportunity to cause some trouble, another colleague posted the message 
 Nerf guns for sale: $1 each. Get’em while they’re hot. 
 That earned a chuckle from me.
