        I answered    this comment directly, but it deserves reiteration with wider  visibility.
  If you don’t #define UNICODE, you get ANSI by default.
  If you want to see characters beyond the boring 7-bit ASCII,  make sure you are using a font that can display those characters.
  I am assuming a level of competence where issues like this  go without saying, so that I can dig into the more advanced topics  without having to explain all the basics, but I have to accept that  people of all levels of programming experience read my stuff.
  But the second part raises an advanced question:  How do you find a font that  can display the characters you want? What if the characters can come  from a source outside your control?  We’ll look at this tomorrow.
