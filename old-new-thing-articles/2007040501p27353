          Conan O’Brien airs clips from Walker, Texas Ranger. The putative excuse for this is that, as a result of the merger of NBC with Universal Studios, he can air clips from the show without paying royalties. The real excuse, of course, is that the clips are just so unintentionally funny. This appears to be a recurring sketch on Conan, so a little hunting around will reveal  plenty of  other  clips. 
 This is, of course, not to be confused with  Chuck Norris Facts or the  Chuck Norris Fact Generator or the Young Chuck Norris sketch from Saturday Night Live…
