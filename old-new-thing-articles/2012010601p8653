        I feel sorry for the people who live near Abbey Road or who have to take that road as part of their daily routine, because  tourists keep blocking traffic to recreate the cover of the eponymous Beatles album.
  The recording studio has a webcam on the intersection so you can watch the mayhem as it happens.
 Update: Just this morning, I checked out the webcam and within two minutes, another group of tourists posed in the zebra crossing.
