        Geocaching is sort of like  global hide-and-seek (with hints) for technology geeks.
  I stumbled upon a non-GPS version of this diversion,  known as  Letterboxing  (not to be confused with  letterboxed  movies, another subject entirely).
  By the way, if geocaching isn’t enough “fun with a GPS” for you,  you can try  The Degree Confluence Project.  See the world with a GPS, experience other cultures, learn a few  words of the local language:  
  The Thais kept asking how many farang (foreigners)  did this and how much they got paid.    I must have heard the phrase “farang Baar”,  (foreigners are crazy) more than a couple of times that evening.
