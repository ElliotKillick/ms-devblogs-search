What are you talking about?          
             Tweak UI is part of the Windows             XP PowerToys. It was recently updated to version 2.10. 
What OS is required?              
                 Windows XP Service Pack 1 (or higher) or Windows Server 2003 (all versions). Not supported:                 Windows XP RTM, Windows 2000, NT 4, Windows 95, 98, or Me. 
Why didn’t you make                 a big announcement? I didn’t find out about it until somebody told me.                  
                     I don’t control the announcements page. I figured word would get out – and it did. 
Why                     is the new Tweak UI so much smaller than the old one?                      
                         Leaner installer program. 
Are you always this terse?                          
                             I’m not sure yet; I’m new at this.
