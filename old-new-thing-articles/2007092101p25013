         In 2006, Christian Buckley set forth on a grand mission: To visit every cafeteria on Microsoftâ€™s Redmond campus. This marathon effort went by the name Microsoft Cafeteria Tour 2006, or for those in the know,  MSCT2k6. 
 Those looking for off-campus dining options can make use of this map mashup of restaurants which provide discounts to Microsoft employees. (Note: Rumored to be out of date, but still a useful starting point.)
