         Some people are confused by the seemingly random behavior when you drag a file.  Do you get a move or a copy? 
 And you’re right to be confused because it’s not obvious until you learn the secret. Mind you, this secret hasn’t changed since 1989, but an old secret is still a secret just the same. (Worse: An old secret is a compatibility constraint.) 

If Ctrl+Shift are held down, then the operation creates a shortcut. 
If Shift is held down, then the operation is a move. 
If Ctrl is held down, then the operation is a copy. 
If no modifiers are held down and the source and destination are     on the same drive, then the operation is a move. 
If no modifiers are held down and the source and destination are     on different drives, then the operation is a copy. 

 This is one of the few places where the fact that there are things called “drives” makes itself known to the end user in a significant way.
