            December 31st, 20130 0
		
         Another round of the semi-annual link clearance. 

          Testing informercial workout systems. 
          Understanding the Galaga No-Fire cheat. 
          Fixing E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial for the Atari 2600. 
          Reasons My Son Is Crying. 
          A technical look at the Win32 thread pool. 
          Creative usernames and Spotify account hijacking.     This is a fascinating security issue caused by a helper library erroneously     assuming that the Unicode specification will never change.     Itâ€™s also one of the nightmare scenarios for backward compatibility:     A change in behavior silently introduces a security vulnerability     into existing code. 

 And, as always, the obligatory plug for my column in TechNet Magazine: 

          The $700 pagers 
          Hiding in plain sight 
          Respect the brand 
          The mystery key 

  The retirement of TechNet Magazine also spells the end of the Windows Confidential column, so this is the last of the obligatory plugs, at least until I have some other obligatory thing to plug.
