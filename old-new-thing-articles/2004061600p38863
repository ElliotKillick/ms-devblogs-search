          It’s often fun to go back and see    the kooky ideas for television shows that floated around years ago.  Here are some from 1997:  

Blade Squad –  An action series set in the year 2001  about a cop who gets around on jet-powered roller skates.   
My Beautiful World –  A comedy whose characters include a Marilyn Monroe impersonator  and a child with the body of a 10-month-old baby  and the head of a Queens cab driver.   
The Notorious –  A drama about seven crime families,  each representing one of the seven deadly sins.   
MV24 –  A sitcom about a music video channel, starring Peter Scolari.   

  Plenty more on the linked web site.  What’s really scary is that a lot of these kooky ideas  turned into actual television programs!
