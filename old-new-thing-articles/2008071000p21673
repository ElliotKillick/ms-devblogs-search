We saw last time
that you can specify a separator in a menu item template
by specifying zero for everything,
even though technically you’re supposed to pass
MFT_SEPARATOR for the flags.
What’s the deal with that alternate
form for menu item template separators?


This goes back to the early days of the
InsertMenu function
(and its friends like
AppendMenu and ModifyMenu).

In the Before Time,
the way you specified a separator was to add a null pointer.
Not a null string (a string with no characters, consisting only
of the null terminator),
but an actual null pointer.


AppendMenu(hmenu, MF_STRING, 0, NULL);


The recommended way of adding a separator is, of course,
to use MF_SEPARATOR,
but this old-fashioned method is still supported for
backward compatibility.
The alternate form of the menu item template for separators
is just a throwback to the days when this “old style” of
adding a separator was in fact the only style.
