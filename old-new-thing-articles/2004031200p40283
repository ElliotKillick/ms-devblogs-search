          Commentator and novelist Christian Bauman    recalls the excitement of receiving mail from anonymous  well-wishers back home during his deployment with the  U.S. Army in Somalia in the early 1990s.  
  This was a fascinating listen.  
  The coup, of course, was getting a letter with a snapshot or  two inside.  I don’t know why, but the further west the return address,  the  more likely the envelope had a picture.  And the more north, the more likely the picture was,  shall we say, “revealing”.  Triangulate this equation,  and you discover that the girls in the northwest get a real  charge out of showing the troops exactly what it is they  are fighting for.  
  Make sure to stick to the end for the punch line.  (Every good story has a punch line.)
