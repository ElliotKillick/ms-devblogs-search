        Ian B wondered  what the difference is between pressing F5 and F8 while Windows is booting.
 I have no idea either. My strategy was to just mash on the function keys, space bar, DEL key, anything else I can think of. Keep pressing them all through the boot process, and maybe a boot menu will show up.
 The F5 hotkey was introduced in Windows 95, where the boot sequence hotkeys were as follows:

ESC – Boot in text mode. 
F5 – Boot in Safe Mode. 
Shift+F5 – Boot to Safe Mode MS-DOS. 
Ctrl+F5 – Boot to Safe Mode MS-DOS with drive compression disabled. 
Alt+F5 – Boot with LOADTOP=0 for Japanese systems. 
F6 – Boot in Safe Mode with networking. 
F4 – Boot to previous version of MS-DOS. 
Ctrl+F4 – Boot to previous version of MS-DOS with drive compression disabled. 
F8 – Boot to menu. 
Shift+F8 – Boot with step-by-step confirmation. 
Ctrl+F8 – Boot with step-by-step confirmation with drive compression disabled. 

 Man, that’s an insane number of boot options all buried behind obscure function keys. Boy am I glad we got rid of them. This frees up room in my brain for things like  Beanie Baby trivia.
 Bonus chatter: The next generation of computers boots so fast that  there’s no time to hit any of these hotkeys!
