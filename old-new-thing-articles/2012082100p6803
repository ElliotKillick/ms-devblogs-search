        Some time ago, I was on the phone when the connection suddenly cut out. I looked at the my phone display and it said, Auto-restart in 7 seconds. The seconds counted down, and then the phone rebooted, and after about ten more seconds, it was back in business, acting like nothing was wrong. (Except that it just terminated a phone call without warning, but hey, whoâ€™s keeping track?)
 Sometimes I think phones are getting too smart for their own good.
 Historical note: This entry was written over four years ago, and the model of IP phone in question has long since been replaced.
