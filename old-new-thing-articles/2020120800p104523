        For a brief period of time, an Insider build of Windows 10 changed the program crash dialog from Windows is checking for a solution to the problem to Windows is opening a portal to another dimension. How did Windows open that portal?
Man, that research department is working overtime.
Sorry to break it to you, but there was no actual portal to another dimension. That placeholder text was created by a friend of mine while the team worked with the writers to figure out what the new text should be. (The text ultimately became Hang on while Windows reports the problem to Microsoft.) My friend noted, “We  made Reddit. My daughter was proud. I also learned that some people don’t want humor in their error messages.”
At least that message was better than the message in the original specification for the feature, which was “Program X has suffered a debilitating brain aneurysm,” a reference to  an old Calvin and Hobbes comic.
Bonus reading:  Did Windows ever find solutions for programs that crashed?
