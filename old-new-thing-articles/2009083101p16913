        A conversation between two friends of mine.
 Friend 1: Here’s the fifteen dollars I owe you. Oh wait, I only have a twenty. Do you have a five?
 Friend 2: I don’t carry cash. Everybody takes credit cards.
 Friend 1: I don’t take credit cards.
 In my imagination, Friend 1 would have responded to “Everybody takes credit cards” with “Well, in that case, here ya go. Put it on my credit card.”
 (The title is a tag line from a Visa credit card advertising campaign from years past.)
