         I’m not really interested in sports. Teams, standings, scores, who got traded to what team, none of that is interesting to me. What I am interested in, however, is “meta-sports”: The business of sports, the technology of sports, the evolution of techniques, changes in the rules, that sort of thing. That’s one of the reasons I’m a fan of the radio program Only a Game. (The other, more important, reason can be summed up in two words:  Charlie Pierce.) 
 All that is a rather lengthy lead-in to  Transition Game, Nick Schulz’s look at the world behind sports. He covers what it is about sports that I like, with none of the stuff I don’t like. (I’ve linked to him before, but I like him so much I’m going to do it again.) You too can learn  how air conditioning revolutionized competitive bicycling. Or you can learn about  the use of robots as camel jockeys in Qatar.  Here’s a picture. It’s like an episode of Futurama come to life.
