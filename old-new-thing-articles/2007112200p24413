        On our team’s web site, buried among the other debugging documents, was a page titled simply “Magic 8 Ball”®¹. If you visited it, you got a dark blue circle with a lighter-blue triangle, on which appeared white text with a randomly-chosen message. The messages were things like

Memory corruption. 
Try a newer build. 
Known bug. 
Can’t connect. 
Hardware failure. 
Looks like a X bug. (Where “X” was a random component.) 

 It was fun to give the 8-ball a shake, but the real purpose of the 8-ball was to be a link sent out in response to failure reports.
 You see, there was a secret URL for each of the 8-ball’s responses, so you could respond to a failure report with something like
 The Magic 8 ball says…  http://internalserver/magic8.asp?TWVGS 
 and when the person clicked on the link, they got an 8-ball that said “Known bug” or “Memory corruption”.
 Some teams liked the 8-Ball’s responses so much, they asked us to add new custom messages to the repertoire.
 Anyway, I was reminded of this by  the story of Radio8Ball.
 ¹Magic 8-Ball is a registered trademark of Tyco Toys, Inc. When the  Tyco scandal hit the airwaves, I always did a double-take before realizing that it was a different company. 

Tyco International = scandal-plagued multinational conglomerate,     cursed by shareholders. 
Tyco Toys = a division of Mattel, maker of the Magic 8 Ball,     beloved by soothsayers.
