        A warehouse in Sweden holding 1000 cans of surströmming  burned to the ground last week. No people were injured.
 The cans of surströmming, already prone to violent decompression under normal conditions, exploded over a period of six hours. Some of them turned into projectiles and shot through the air.
 No information on what effect this will have on the supply of  surströmming ice cream. I knew you were wondering.
