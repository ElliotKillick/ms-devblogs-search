        A few years ago,  Marketplace radio reported on the sub-industry of top ten lists, specifically the lists intended to be used as gift guides. Marketing companies drool over these lists, since placement on them can mean a tremendous boost in sales, and they’re anxious to do whatever it takes to get on the list. For example, The Da Vinci Code was a relatively unknown title until the American Booksellers Assocation placed it on their own “best picks” list.
 In the story, c|net comes off looking good, standing their ethical ground against marketers looking for an endorsement. The Today Show doesn’t fare as well.
  On the Media reports on the subject as well.
