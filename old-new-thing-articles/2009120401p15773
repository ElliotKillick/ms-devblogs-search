        Every so often, someone posts a really funny comment, and I feel stupid just posting the remark “Haha, that was funny” or even worse “LOL”. So I’m going to try giving them a star instead.
  Chris Blackwell wins the first star.
 Hopefully people won’t post comments just fishing for a star. (I realize that this is a vain hope and that I will probably have to cancel the star program within the week.)
