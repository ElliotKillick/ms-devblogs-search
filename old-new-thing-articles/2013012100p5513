        Today is  Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, a  federal holiday in the United States honoring the civil rights leader and formally serving as a day to  reflect on the principles of racial equality and nonviolent social change and more generally to  honor Dr. King’s legacy through service.
 At Microsoft, the day has been recognized with an event whose name is, um, well, the name keeps changing. Here are the names from recent years: 

2006: Martin Luther King, Jr. Day Event 
2007: Martin Luther King, Jr. Celebration 
2008: Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day Event 
2009: MLK Day Event 
2010: Celebration to Honor Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. 
2011: Martin Luther King Day of Celebration 
2012: Martin Luther King, Jr. Day of Celebration 
2013: Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day of Celebration Event 

 I like to think this is done intentionally just to keep people on their toes. 
 Ironically, although the event “celebrates diversity and inclusion,” the email announcing the event inadvertently excludes people with visual impairments because it consists of a giant JPG with no ALT text. 
 (No dream report from me today. That would be disrespectful to  the man himself.)
