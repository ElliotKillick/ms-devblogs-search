         I know nothing about cars. Driving fast scares me. But I still enjoy the British car show  Top Gear. The hosts clearly enjoy driving, and they don’t hold back in their commentary. (“This was the first seven-seat 4×4 designed by someone who had children, not by an engineer who read about them in a book.”) Last week was their  Winter Olympics Episode, and it did not disappoint. They drove a biathlon (with Jeremy of course cheating unabashedly). They raced a Jaguar against a speed skater. Plenty of other events. But the highlight was sending a Mini down the ski jump.  Watch it. (Warning: One-hour video.)
