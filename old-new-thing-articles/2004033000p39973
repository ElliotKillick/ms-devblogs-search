          The [U.S.] government is taking the first steps toward a  targeted military draft of Americans with    special skills in computers and foreign languages.   
  Apparently,  there is already a special system to draft “health care  personnel”, whatever that means.
  Can you imagine the havoc that could be wrought by  disgruntled programmers forced to write code for the government?
  So all I have to do now is volunteer at the local hospital  and I’ll have hit the conscription jackpot.
