        alexx is looking for a  keyboard-only equivalent to the ctrl+click trick I mentioned a few days ago.

Ctrl+Shift+Esc: This opens Task Manager. 
From the Applications tab, use     Ctrl+Space to select the two windows you want. 
Alt+W (open the Windows menu) 
V (Tile Vertically) 

 Not as quick, but it still works. And it works  even if the windows you want got converted into a group.
 Of course, on WindowsÂ 7, you can use the Win+Left and Win+Right hotkeys. (Users with multiple monitors can  couple this with Win+Shift+Left and Win+Shift+Right.)
