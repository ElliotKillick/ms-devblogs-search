        I signed up for the annual  Seattle-to-Portland bike ride, known to Seattle-area bicycling dorks as STP. My bicycle riding is mostly just commuting to and from work, nothing even approaching the 200-mile trek that STP entails, but one of my friends who recently started bicycle-commuting inspired our little bicycle commuting group to sign up.
 One of my colleagues rode the STP last year, and when he returned, I asked him how it went. He conceded that he was riding with a group that wanted to go faster than he was prepared to ride, and the ride was not quite as enjoyable as it could have been.
 “I should’ve trained better.”
 Oh? What was your training?
 “I sat around and drank beer.”
