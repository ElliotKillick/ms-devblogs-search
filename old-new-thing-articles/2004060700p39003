          Two legs good â€“ four wheels bad.  (With apologies  to George Orwell.)  
    Researchers link increase car use with obesity.  
  Each hour spent in a car was associated with a 6 percent  increase in the likelihood of obesity and  each half-mile walked per day reduced those odds by nearly 5 percent,  the researchers found.   
    A study last year came to a similar conclusion.  Good to know that quality research yields quality results.
