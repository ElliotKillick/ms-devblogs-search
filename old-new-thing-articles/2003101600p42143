             Last month, the printers were reconfigured in our building and we got an announcement     that went like this: 

         Subject: Printer/Copier Reconfiguration     
         Microsoft Digital         Campus Program      
         Action Required      
         blah blah blah printers are being reconfigured blah blah blah      
     Action(s) to be taken: No     action is required as the print path information will remain the same. 
Sometimes     you have to do nothing, and that counts as doing something.
