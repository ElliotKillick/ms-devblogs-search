        Four years ago, Troy Kleweno spotted Christine Hsieh on  the 308 bus. He saw her twice a day, once in the morning on the way to work, and again in the evening on the way home. His co-workers teased him about the “bus girl” he pined after for six months before he finally  said hello. That led to a date, and soon they were a couple.
 It’s only fitting then that when Troy decided that  it was time to propose marriage, that he do it  on the 308 bus.  Watch it here. 
 Happy Valentine’s Day, everybody.
