        Marketing writes the big print; lawyers write the small print.
 I bought some portable stereo headphones.  The front of the box says you can use it “while in-line skating, power walking, biking, jogging, skiing, running, weightlifting, climbing and more.” (Emphasis mine.)
 The back of the box says that it should not be used “while driving or cycling.”
