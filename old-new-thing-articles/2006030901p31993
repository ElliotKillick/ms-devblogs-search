        Caught out by the FDA.
 I happened to be in the bug spray section of the store when I spotted a bottle of mosquito repellant that proudly proclaimed “100% DEET”. 
 But the FDA-mandated labelling tells a different story:


Active ingredients





N, N diethyl-m-toluamide
          



95%





Other isomers
 



5%


 Similarly,  foods labeled “zero fat” are actually allowed to contain up to a half gram of fat. (Well, up to but not including.) This is a definition of “zero” with which I had previously been unfamiliar.
