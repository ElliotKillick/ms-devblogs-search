        One of my colleagues pointed out that my web site is listed in the references section of  this whitepaper. It scares me that I’m being used as formal documentation because that is explicitly what this web site isn’t. I wrote back,
 I really need to put a disclaimer on my web site. 
 FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY 

 Remember, this is a blog. The opinions (and even some facts) expressed here are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Microsoft Corporation. Nothing I write here creates an obligation on Microsoft or establishes the company’s official position on anything. I am not a spokesperson. I’m just this guy who strings people along in the hopes that they might hear a funny story once in a while.
 You’d think this was obvious, but apparently there are people who think that somehow  what I write has the weight of official Microsoft policy and take my sentences apart as if they were legal documents or who take my articles and declare them to be  official statements from Microsoft Corporation.
