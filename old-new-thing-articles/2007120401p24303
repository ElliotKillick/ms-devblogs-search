         Todd Gallagher answers  the weird sports questions you always wondered but knew were too stupid even to ask. Think of it as the sports version of  Mythbusters.

Would a team of midgets be the greatest offense in baseball history,     because they would draw walk after walk after walk? 
Could a morbidly obese goalie shut out an NHL team? 
Could an average person beat a professional tennis player if the     pro had to use a frying pan instead of a racquet? 

 Well, he sort of gives away the answer to the last question in the title of his book,  Andy Roddick Beat Me with a Frying Pan. The stories behind how he set about finding the answers to these absurd questions are even more entertaining than the answers themselves! Here’s  an interview with Only a Game‘s Bill Littlefield.

 On a somewhat concidental note, tonight I’m going to watch the  Seattle Thunderbirds take on the  Tri-City Americans, making good on  my earlier admission of the possibility of seeing another hockey game. Hopefully with normal-sized goalies.
