        My colleague  Nick Kramer who works over on WPF has the first of what will be a series of articles on  USER and GDI compatibility in Windows Vista. The changes to tighten security, improve support for East Asian languages, and take the desktop to a new level with the Desktop Window Manager (among others) make for quite an interesting compatibility risk list.
 And since I mentioned the DWM, you would do well to check out  Greg Schechter who  has been writing about the Desktop Window Manager, how it works, how it fits into the rest of the system, all that stuff. I know some people have been posting comments asking for information about the DWM. You would be much better served asking Greg since he actually works on it, whereas all I know about the DWM is how to spell it.
