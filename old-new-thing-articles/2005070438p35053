         (Note: This makes sense only after you’ve gone through the other puzzles.) 
 In case my friend got stuck, she could call me and ask for a hint. The original plan was that I would charge her a dare in order to get a hint, but it turns out I was too nice a guy to make her do any of the following things, but here’s the list anyway: 

Scream “I love you, Seattle!” at a street corner 
Skip across the street 
Walk sideways 
Caress a lamppost 
Dance 
Sing the national anthem (any country) [typo fixed 7/6] 
Ask for directions to where you are 
Recite six lines from a favorite book or poem 
Wave and shout hello to a traffic light 


        
                

        
		
                

            
            
                
                    Raymond Chen                
                
            
            

                
        
            Follow
