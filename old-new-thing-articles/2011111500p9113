         Fontography is like wine. The connoisseurs speak in a language that only superficially resembles English. 
 Here’s a list of words. Which of them are terms used in fontography, and which are just pretentious blather? 

aloof 
assertive 
cold 
cuddly 
humanist 
international 
neutral 
no-nonsense 
open 
quirky 

 If you aren’t familiar with font speak, here’s a sample I stole from  an old article on the evolution of the Internet explorer logo: 
 In  The Elements of Typographic Style by Robert Bringhurst, “this typeface is described as a heavy un-modulated line and tiny aperture (which) evoke an image of uncultivated strength, force and persistence.”
