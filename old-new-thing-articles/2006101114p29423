        Somebody at a meeting two years ago used the term “goat rodeo” to describe a completely confused situation. The term stuck with me as a really funny folksy analogy. It’s not official Microspeak, but who knows, it may someday gain currency. I certainly enjoy saying it.
 “Goat rodeo.”
 “Goat rodeo.”
 “Goat rodeo.”
 (Some earlier Microspeak entries:  schedule chicken,  baking.)
