         When I saw Tim Sneath‘s description of  the root cause for all the Windows Vista product key problems, I was amazed that the reason was something my readers tend to go completely ballistic over: Long file names. 
 It so happens that one of the ISO mounting tools that people were using for installing Windows Vista doesn’t support long file names! (At least not by default.)
