        A customer observed that according to Task Manager, their CPU was running faster than the maximum speed. How is that even possible? 





Utilization
Speed


66%
2.90GHz






Maximum speed:
2.50GHz


Sockets:
1


Cores:
2





The processor’s maximum speed is 2.50GHz, but it’s running at 2.90GHz? I know that athletes give 110% effort, but this processor is giving 116%! 
This is a feature of Intel Turbo Boost Technology 2.0, which runs a processor above its rated frequency if they are “operating below power, current, and temperature specification limits.” 
To me, this sounds like the CPU can dynamically overclock itself.
