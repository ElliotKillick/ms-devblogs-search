         For those unfamiliar with Sandra Lee, her gimmick is that the ingredients in her recipes are primarily prepared foods, a food-preparation technique (I’m reluctant to call it cooking) which she calls “semi-homemade.” 
 First,  the creation one critic called “an edible hate crime.” 
 Next,  the apology from the creator. 
 I guess I imagined something more refined. And I know the Corn Nuts were disgusting, but she didn’t. As a matter of fact, the more tasteless the recipes got the more she liked them, the faster she approved them.
