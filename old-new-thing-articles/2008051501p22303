         A year and a half ago, I stumbled across the essay  Selling Your Life for a Quarter at a Time by  Tim Barcz and found it quietly poignant. (Unfortunately, the spammers also found the essay and decided to fill it with garbage links. So much for poignant.) 
 I tried to come up with a catchy tagline for this entry, but nothing worked. Coming up with something snappy would just be a disservice.
