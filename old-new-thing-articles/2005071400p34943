A Windows 95 story in commemoration of the tenth anniversary
of its release to manufacturing (RTM).



Danny Glasser
explains

where the names for the computer opponents in the game Hearts came from.


I didn’t myself know where the names came from, but Danny’s explanation
of the source of the Windows 95 names
brought back memories of the child of one of our co-workers,
whose name I will not reveal but you can certainly narrow it down
to one of three.
He/she was exceedingly well-behaved and definitely helped to
make those long hours slightly more tolerable.
I remember once we heard the receptionist’s voice come over the
public address system, which was itself quite a shock because
nobody ever uses the public address system.
The message was, “Will X please come to the receptionist’s desk.
Your son/daughter is here.”



Space Cadet JimH
picks up the story and

explains how he went about writing the computer player logic.
(And no, the computer players don’t cheat.)
