         I happened to spot an online advertisement for a company that will  help you enter the lottery for a United States Permanent Resident Card, commonly known as a Green Card (even though they card isnâ€™t green any more). The advertisement was illustrated with a picture of a United States passport. 
 Um, a Green Card is not the same as a passport, nor does a Green Card authorize you to obtain a passport. Passports are for citizens, not alien permanent residents.
