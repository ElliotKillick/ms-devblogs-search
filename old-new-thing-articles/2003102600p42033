         For Hallowe’en this year, I’m going to be the         Nobel Peace Prize. (I like being things that people would never         even think of as a possible Hallowe’en costume. Last year, I was an inter-office envelope.         People addressed me from place to place.)      
         I chose the Nobel Peace Prize in part because I’m studying Swedish so I thought it         would be fun to be something Swedish.          Except that the Nobel Peace Prize is Norwegian!         Oh, the horror!      
         But what’s done is done. I already made the medal and have started making the diploma,         but I hit a snag: Whose name should be on the Prize?      
         I could go historical and reproduce the 2002         Nobel Peace Prize awarded to Jimmy Carter. (He’s my favorite of the recent Peace         Prize recipients.)      
         Or I could go surreal and create an imaginary award to be bestowed upon Jennifer Lopez         or maybe David Hasselhoff.      
         Or I could just leave the space blank and invite people to nominate a winner.      
         My other problem is making the check for SEK 10,000,000. I asked my friend in Sweden         what a check looks like and he says he’s never seen one. He doesn’t know anybody who         actually writes checks. The closest I could find is this         novelty check but it doesn’t look very convincing. (There’s no bank name or check number, for         example.)  So I’m asking you for help. Can somebody describe what a Swedish check looks like?
