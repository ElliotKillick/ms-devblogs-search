        You can buy    510 grams of peanut butter for only $501.
  Of course, this is special peanut butter.  It must be kept at -20°C.  And it is not intended for human consumption.
  This is peanut butter from the  National Institute of Standards  and Technology  intended for use by food analysis laboratories to  calibrate their equipment.  For example, standard peanut butter consists of  10.4% ± 0.2% saturated fat.
