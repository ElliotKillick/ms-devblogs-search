         The quintennial  International Frederick Chopin Piano Competition will be held later this year, and I was reminded that the awards for “Best performance of a mazurka” and “Best performance of a concerto” have not been awarded  since 1985. Simply put: Nobody since 1985 has been good enough to deserve it. 
  The year 1995 was a particularly bad year for Chopin-lovers. The judges for Competition XIII concluded that none of the 130 entrants deserved any of the four big-name prizes. 

First prize – not awarded. 
Best perfomance of the mazurkas – not awarded. 
Best performance of a polonaise – not awarded. 
Best performance of a concerto – not awarded. 

 (This wasn’t the first time the judges refused to award first prize. It happened  five years earlier as well.)
