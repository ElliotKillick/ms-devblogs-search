          David Anson digests  my earlier series on virtual drag/drop and  translates it into managed code. His example of dragging his entire RSS feed is an excellent illustration of dragging dynamically-generated virtual content. (I didnâ€™t use an example like that because the purpose of the What a drag series was to get something done in the least amount of code, and generating a stream from a URL takes an awful lot of code when doing it from the unmanaged side, which would ultimately detract from the point of the example.) 
 Bonus: He takes the example further by  adding asynchronous support.
