        A colleague of mine forwarded me some status mail from his team’s internal bug push. (This is a push to fix bugs, not a push to introduce new bugs.) Apparently, one of the ways the developers lifted the tension was to discover some new  Chuck Norris Facts, two of which were shared in the status mail:
  Chuck facts today: 

Chuck Norris has never needed          more than 640K of memory. 
Chuck Norris taught Raymond Chen Win32 programming. 


 Happy birthday, Chuck! 
 (Remember, don’t let the facts get in the way of a good story.) 
 Bonus:  Google-internal Chuck Norris facts.
