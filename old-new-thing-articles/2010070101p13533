          KCRW’s The Business reveals how the sausage of the entertainment industry is made. Here are some of my favorites: 

     Bill Mechanic discusses the experience of producing the Oscar Awards,     trying to make it more than just an award show, and failing. 
Gregg Gelfand, associate director of American Idol          describes what happens in the director’s booth during a live show     and reveals a dirty little secret about the end-of-episode montage.     (Related:     Overheard in the Control Room.) 
J.D. Shapiro and Corey Mandell, the two credited screenwriters     for the movie Battlefield Earth     (the          worst picture of the decade), never met.          Hear their story of how the project came to be,     and how it went off the rails.
