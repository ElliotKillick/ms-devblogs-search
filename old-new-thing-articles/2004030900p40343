          I will be in Stockholm from March 24th to April 7th,  with an excursion to GÃ¶teborg thrown in at some point  yet to be determined, probably the 29th to the 1st.  So the blog will be on autopilot for a few weeks.  (Assuming I can even generate that much advance  material. If not, then it will just plain go quiet.)
