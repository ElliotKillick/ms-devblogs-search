        YouTube channel EveryOtherBeat takes popular songs and removes every other beat. So does the Tumblr EverySecondBeat.
Here’s how you can create your own:

Go to  The Infinite Jukebox. The original purpose of this site is to make a song infinitely long by finding sections that are self-similar and using them to splice the song into an infinite loop. But we’ll use its feature to remove every other beat.
Pick a song you would like to transform.
Click the Tune button.
Set the Branch Similarity Threshold to the minimum, and uncheck Loop extension optimization. These operations create a straight path through the song with no looping.
Hit the right-arrow key once. This sets the play velocity to 2x, which removes every other beat. (More keyboard shortcuts can be found under the FAQ link.)
Click Play and enjoy.
