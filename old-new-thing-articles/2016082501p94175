        We already have a giant Ferris wheel. And opening today, right next door to the Great Wheel, we get Wings over Washington, a Washington-themed version of Soarin’ over California Around the World, 
Surprisingly, there has been very little publicity about this new attraction. If anybody goes, let me know what you think. 
At least it wasn’t an Eiffel Tower knock-off.
