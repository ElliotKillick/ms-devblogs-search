        Former Microsoft “big-time important guy” Charles Simonyi wants to be  the first nerd in space. In  this BBC article, he says that he is even learning Russian so he can better understand the systems aboard the Soyuz spacecraft that will take him up and back.
 (Note to the humor-impaired: Joke begins here.)
 When his Russian hosts learned this, they quickly took down all the labels from the knobs and dials aboard the spacecraft and replaced them with tags that read “Руками не трогать!”
