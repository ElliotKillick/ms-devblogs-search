         NFL rookies are required to attend “How not to mess up your life like those other professional athletes” training. They learn about such things as sexual harassment, AIDS, common-law marriage, and, of course, taxes.
 Kendrell Bell, a Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker, tells of his great awakening to the verities of income tax: “I got a million-dollar signing bonus. But then I got the check, and it was only $624,000. I thought, Oh, well, I’ll get the other half later. Then I found out that’s all there was. I thought, They can’t do this to me. Then I got on the Internet and I found out they can.” 
 Shocking!  Football players have to pay income tax!  Where will the injustice end?
