        Public Service Announcement: Daylight Saving Time ends in most parts of the United States this weekend.
 I pointed out  some time ago that Win32 and .NET deal with daylight saving time differently. Specifically, Win32 always deals with the time zone you are currently in (even if itâ€™s not the time zone that corresponds to the timestamp you are manipulating), whereas .NET deals with the time zone that was in effect at the time the timestamp was generated. 
 For more details on the latter, I refer you to Josh Free from  the BCL Team Blog, who some time ago explained  how to work with ambiguous and invalid points in time in managed code.
