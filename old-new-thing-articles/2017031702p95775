        North Bend is a small town about a half-hour’s drive from Seattle, perhaps best known as one of the cities which provided shooting locations for the cult television show Twin Peaks. 
Earlier this month, the police blotter revealed another intrigue brewing in the quiet town of North Bend: 

Friday, March 3 
Confusion: At 12:25 p.m., police were called to the 500 block of E North Bend Way, North Bend, to address a claim of identity theft. When police arrived, the caller said that someone was trying to steal his birthright to the Irish royal throne. Police determined there was no crime and cleared the scene.
