        In order to help set off content in email messages, for example, to demarcate a code snippet, I will often put it in a box. 

… but consider the following class: 
class Muffin{public:  void Bake();}; 

One of my colleagues apparently was fascinated by this technique and couldn’t figure out how it was done. “Okay, I give up. How do you get the nifty text boxes in your emails?” 
You’re going to hate yourself when I tell you the secret. 
Just use this one weird trick. 
Tell your email program to insert a 1×1 table. Paste your text into the table. 
It’s that simple!
