        I didn’t get a chance to thank you after the concert, but I did want to express my appreciation for the running commentary you provided during the performance of last week’s concert of Debussy, Schönberg and Brahms.
 Most people wait until the break between pieces, some may even dare to exchange information in whispers during the performance, but you were smart. You realized that whispered information is barely audible to anyone more than a seat away, so you spoke in a normal voice, allowing audience members like me to hear your insightful commentary. Here’s an example of your astute observational skills:
 Person 1: “The conductor is quite animated.”
 Person 2: “That’s because the music is loud.”
