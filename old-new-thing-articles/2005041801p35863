         In December 2003,  I reported on Steve Currey’s expedition to the hole at the top of the earth, which  at the time was scheduled for June 26, 2005. But on May 6, 2004,  the site rescheduled the trip for Jun 26, 2006 with no explanation. The reservation form reminds you that the 25% deposit is non-refundable. 
 Far be it from me to suggest that these people are just stringing their loyal following along, pocketing the $4000 deposit, with no intention of actually mounting the expedition. That would be patently unfair of me. I’m certain there’s a perfectly reasonable and honorable explanation for the delay.
