        Actual feedback submitted to    the microsoft.com web site many years ago.
  id: 13726  Date: 1996-07-29 17:27:41.997  Name: ***********  Email: *************  Area: Windows 95  Comments:  PLEASE read this entire email as it is quite serious.  I just discovered today that in the Windows 95 operating system,  there are no switches, command line options,  or any way whatsoever to have the XCOPY command include  hidden/system files in it’s operations.  It is clear that at some point in the development of the Windows 95 product,  that somebody made a conscious decision to implement the xcopy command in this manner.  It is also clear from looking at the Windows NT XCOPY command  that it can be implemented in the manner I describe.  Therefore, let me give fair warning. This may not be easy,  and I will expect no help from Microsoft in finding out who  this person (or persons) was that made this decision,  but….eventually I will find out who made this decision,  and I will kill them.  This is not an idle threat – I will pursue this matter  until it is resolved…whoever is responsible for this incredibly  ridiculous implementation of what would be an otherwise useful  tool will die at my hands, hopefully in a bloody, painful fashion.  You will not get away. -J*hn ******   
  J*hn, if you’re still out there… the switch for copying  hidden files on Windows 95 is /H.  Same as Windows NT.
  Please don’t kill me.
