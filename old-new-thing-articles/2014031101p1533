        Spock’s Brain is generally considered to be the worst episode of Star Trek. That may be why in 2009 Mike Carano decided to perform it as a theatrical production.  Here is the opening scene, and  here’s Carano talking about the show’s genesis. In the second video, skip ahead to 2:40 to see more clips from the show, or go to 4:35 for the fight scene.
 Whereas Carano played the show for laughs, the folks at  Atomic Arts in Portland (yes,  that Portland) played it straight for their Trek in the Park series, but they still get laughs because Star Trek.

 And yes, when the Enterprise is hit,  everybody jerks to the left or right, even the unconscious bodies in sickbay.
 Their five-year mission complete,  the Atomic Arts folks are unloading their larger set pieces, so if you always wanted a pair of sickbay beds that can pump Vulcan blood, well now you know where to go.
 But just because Trek in the Park is over doesn’t mean you should give up on Star Trek live in the park yet. Seattle arts group  Hello Earth Productions continues to stage Star Trek episodes in public parks under the name Outdoor Trek. Hello Earth aims for a more creative interpretation rather than trying to do a perfect impersonation of the original.
