We’ve seen that

icons and cursors know where they came from,
and the window manager uses this information when you ask it
to change the size of an icon.
But not all icons carry this information,
only icons created by passing a HINSTANCE and
a resource name.


You can use this to your advantage if you want to destroy
the module and resource information associated with an icon.
For example, the CreateIconIndirect function
creates an icon from raw bitmap information without reference
to an HINSTANCE or a resource name.
This allows you to create icons at runtime, but it also allows
you to create an icon that “throws away” the bonus information.


HICON CopyIconWithoutResourceInfo(HICON hicoSrc)
{
  ICONINFO ii;
  HICON hico = NULL;
  if (GetIconInfo(hicoSrc, &ii)) {
    hico = CreateIconIndirect(&ii);
    if (ii.hbmMask) DeleteObject(ii.hbmMask);
    if (ii.hbmColor) DeleteObject(ii.hbmColor);
  }
  return hico;
}


Now, throwing away this information is a desperation move,
because it prevents the window manager from using the original
resource information when resizing an icon,
resulting in ugly stretched icons.


You might even be throwing this information away by mistake.
For example, if your program is asked to produce an icon,
it’s best if you load the icon with a function like
LoadImage because that records the bonus information;
if the caller decides to resize the icon, it can do so with the
CopyImage function while retaining full fidelity.
On the other hand, if you use a function like
ExtractIcon or CreateIconFromResource,
that will not have the bonus information, and any icon stretching
that takes place will end up looking pretty ugly.
