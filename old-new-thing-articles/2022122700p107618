        A customer found that when they deployed Windows and booted into audit mode, they were unable to print anything.
If they were not in audit mode, then everything printed fine. It was just audit mode that was broken. They wanted to know how to print in audit mode.
Don’t print in audit mode.
 Audit mode is for you to configure your system in preparation for resealing it, so that the next boot will run through the Out of Box Experience, commonly abbreviated OOBE and pronounced /oo-bee/. You aren’t expected to be using the system as a normal user. Install the apps, make your final tweaks, and reseal that puppy.
Specifically, a number of services are disabled in audit mode. It’s not surprising that printing wouldn’t work.
