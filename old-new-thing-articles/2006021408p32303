        Somewhat belatedly riffing on Larry and his discussion of  time bombs in beta products, I’m reminded of one instance of a major PC manufacturer who apparently couldn’t wait for Windows 95 to RTM. Tired of waiting, they shipped several thousands of machines with a late beta version of Windows 95 instead.
 That worked out really great.  For six months.
 And then all the computers expired.
 Boy did they have a lot of ‘splainin’ to do.
