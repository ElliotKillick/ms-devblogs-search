Windows Management Instrumentation
is a scriptable interface to configuration information.
This saves you the trouble of having to figure it out yourself.


For example, here’s a little program that enumerates all the CPUs
in your system and prints some basic information about them.


var locator = WScript.CreateObject(“WbemScripting.SWbemLocator”);
var services = locator.ConnectServer();
var cpus = new Enumerator(services.ExecQuery(“SELECT * FROM Win32_Processor”));
while (!cpus.atEnd()) {
  var cpu = cpus.item();
  WScript.StdOut.WriteLine(“cpu.ProcessorType=” + cpu.ProcessorType);
  WScript.StdOut.WriteLine(“cpu.CurrentClockSpeed=” + cpu.CurrentClockSpeed);
  WScript.StdOut.WriteLine(“cpu.MaxClockSpeed=” + cpu.MaxClockSpeed);
  WScript.StdOut.WriteLine(“cpu.Manufacturer=” + cpu.Manufacturer);
  WScript.StdOut.WriteLine();
  cpus.moveNext();
}


Save this program as cpus.js and run it via
cscript cpus.js.


There’s a whole lot of other information kept inside WMI.
You can get lost amidst

all the classes that exist.

The Scripting Guys
have their own tool called

WMI Scriptomatic
which lets you cruise around the WMI namespace.
(The Scripting Guys also wrote

Tweakomatic
which comes with hilarious documentation.)


Added 11am:
It appears that people have misunderstood the point of this entry.
The point here is not to show how to print the results to the screen.
(I just did that to prove it actually worked.)
The point is that you can let
WMI do the hard work of actually digging up the information
instead of having to hunt it down yourself.
Want BIOS information?  Try

Win32_BIOS.  Change the query to “SELECT * FROM Win32_BIOS” and
you can get the manufacturer from the Manufacturer property.

Plenty more examples in MSDN.
