         Internet Explorer 3 came with the IRC client  Comic Chat, a product from the research division. And it’s not surprising that a program as goofy as Comic Chat would put something goofy in the default profile. If you didn’t set a profile when you created your character, it defaulted to “This person is too lazy to create a profile entry.” 
 Of course, it wasn’t long before people complained that  the text was snotty. So much for trying to be funny.
