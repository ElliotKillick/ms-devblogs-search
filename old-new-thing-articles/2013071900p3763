        You might think that if you want to get read/write access, you could pass STGM_READ | STGM_WRITE. You would be wrong. You have to pass STGM_READ­WRITE.
 The three flags STGM_READ, STGM_WRITE, and STGM_READ­WRITE are mutually exclusive. If you try to combine them, you get a weird mess.
 In particular, since the numerical value of STGM_READ is zero, passing STGM_READ | STGM_WRITE is numerically equivalent to passing STGM_WRITE, which grants write-only access.
 The documentation for the STGM_* constants specifically says “It is not valid to use more than one element from a single group,” and STGM_READ and STGM_WRITE belong to the Access group (as does STGM_READ­WRITE).
 These values date back to the days of MS-DOS, where function 3Dh (Open File) passed an access mode in the AL register.

 The bottom three bits specified the requested access (0 = read-only, 1 = write-only, 2 = read/write), and the remaining bits were reserved.
 Later, when networking support was added in approximately MS-DOS 3.5, three more bits were pressed into service:

 Sharing modes were 0 = compatibility mode, 1 = deny all, 2 = deny write, 3 = deny read, 4 = deny none.
 These values were carried forward into Windows as flags to the  Open­File function: 


Value
Description


OF_READ0x00000000
Opens a file for reading only.


OF_WRITE0x00000001
Opens a file for write access only.


OF_READ­WRITE0x00000002
Opens a file with read/write permissions.


OF_SHARE­COMPAT0x00000000
Opens a file with compatibility mode, allows any process     on a specified computer to open the file any number of times.


OF_SHARE­EXCLUSIVE0x00000010
Opens a file with exclusive mode and denies both read/write     ccess to other processes.


OF_SHARE­DENY­WRITE0x00000020
Opens a file and denies write access to other processes.


OF_SHARE­DENY­READ0x00000030
Opens a file and denies read access to other processes.


OF_SHARE­DENY­NONE0x00000040
Opens a file without denying read or write access to other processes.


 These flags were then carried forward into the  STGM constants with the same numerical values.
