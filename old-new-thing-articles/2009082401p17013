         Robins in Sheffield  sing at night because itâ€™s too noisy in the daytime. That reminds me that when I was in Antigua, Guatemala, I was told that the songbirds in the city have started mimicking car alarms. Apparently this is also happening in Oregon  with birds mimicking car alarms and cell phone ring tones.
