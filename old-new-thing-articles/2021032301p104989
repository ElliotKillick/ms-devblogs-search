         For  many  years,  I’ve  put  together  a  little  pocket  guide  to the  Seattle  Symphony  subscription  season for my symphony friends to help them decide which ticket package they want. At some point, we may start subscribing again, but for now, we pick-and-choose individual concerts.
Here’s the at-a-glance season guide for the 2021/2022 season, still with no comments from me because it’s not worth trying to rate every piece to help my friends pick one concert. If you’re my friend and want recommendations, just call. Besides, you can probably preview nearly all of the pieces nowadays (minus the premieres) by searching on YouTube.
Note: Revised for expanded season announced on June 28, 2021.

This is Thomas Dausgaard’s third season as the Seattle Symphony’s music director, although he was unable to take the podium for his second season due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

For those not familiar with the Seattle Symphony ticket package line-ups: Most of the ticket packages are named Masterworks nX where n is the number of concerts in the package, and the letter indicates the variation. Ticket packages have been combined if they are identical save for the day of the week. For example, 7C and 7D are the same concerts; the only difference is that 7C is for Thursday nights, while 7D is for Saturday nights.
Notes and changes:

The entire 2020–2021 season was cancelled due to the  COVID-19 pandemic. Replacement concerts were held with no audience in the hall and programs compatible with physically-distanced performers. The replacement concerts were streamed live to all subscribers regardless of ticket package. Details are on  the 2020/2021 page.
Live streaming continues for the 2021-2022 season in the form of a new series named Watch and Listen. It includes 13 regular-season Masterworks concerts, plus seven additional concerts from other series. The Watch and Listen series is complimentary for donors at the Friends level or higher. (Technically, you can also buy the series without a membership, but it costs the same, so  you may as well get the membership.)
Only the Opening Night Gala and the Masterworks and Untuxed series were included in the original Spring 2021 announcement. In the Summer 2021 update Pops, Baroque & Wine, In Recital, and Chamber returned to the schedule, as well as two new series. One is the Watch and Listen series noted above. The other is Octave 9, which explores the fusion of music and technology. (Octave 9 was originally planned for the cancelled 2020–2021 season.)
The 5-concert Friday afternoon Masterworks series has been removed from the schedule.
Safety measures have been put into place for live performances.
The Masterworks concert line-up has been reduced from 22 to 21 concerts. This reduces the 8C and 8D series to 7C and 7D.
The 7[AB], 7[CD], and 7[EF] concert series do not overlap, so you can create your own pseudo-series by taking any two of them, or recreate the 21-concert series by taking all three.
The 13-concert series is the same as the 7[CD] and 7[EF] series combined, minus the March 3 concert.
Conductor Emeritus Ludovic Morlot returns to the podium for the concerts on the weekend of June 2.
The web page for the  Family Connections program is still up, but I suspect they have suspended it for this season. It provides free symphony tickets for up to two children with the purchase of an adult ticket.
Avi Avital’s cancelled Four Seasons concert from the 2020/2021 season has been rescheduled for January 13.
Violinist Ray Chen’s recital from the 2020/2021 season was cancelled, but he’ll try again, this time performing the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto on November 4. No relation.
Khatia Buniatishvili was the scheduled artist in residence for the cancelled 2020–2021 season, so we never got to see her. This year, Yuja Wang performs in recital. (Still waiting for Alice Sara Ott.)
This year begins a two-year cycle of Sibelius symphonies plus the original version of the Violin Concerto.
Shouldn’t the February 18 concert be titled ¡España! with the inverted exclamation point?
Over the years, the format of the Seattle Symphony official brochure has gradually gotten closer and closer to the format of this pocket guide. This makes my job both easier and arguably superfluous.
