        My colleague Mario Hewart just let me know that he and Daniel Pravat will be presenting at the PDC pre-con. In case you don’t recognize the names, they’re the authors of Advanced Windows Debugging, a book which I reviewed  late last year.
 So if you want to get your debugging tips directly from the source, you know where to go. 
 Besides, Mario speaks Swedish, so he’s already awesome by default.
