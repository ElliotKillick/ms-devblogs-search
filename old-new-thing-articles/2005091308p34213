        Sorry to all you PDCers who stopped by the Fundamentals Lounge to see me. The scheduling software that the PDC organizers cooked up is, um, “suboptimal” and listed me for Tuesday 11.30a–2.30p instead of 2.30p–5.30p. During the early afternoon shift, I was actually in the Hands-On Lab. But I’ll be in the Lounge on Thursday after my talk all afternoon, really.
 I will try to be in the Lounge on Wednesday, but I may have to take refuge in the Speaker Prep Room to deal with a major last-minute change to my talk. 
 Whoa a huge stream of people just flooded in. I’ll catch up with you folks later.
