        Suppose you have a Unicode code unit wchar_t and you want to know whether it represents a numeric digit. If you have the ICU library, you can check if its code point’s u_charType is U_DECIMAL_DIGIT_NUMBER. But what about plain Win32? 
For Win32, you can use the Get­String­TypeW function to obtain properties for each code unit. 

bool IsUnicodeDigit(wchar_t ch)
{
    WORD type;
    return GetStringTypeW(CT_CTYPE1, &ch, 1, &type) &&
           (type & C1_DIGIT);
}

We ask the Get­String­TypeW function for the CT_CTYPE1 value for one character, passing an output buffer of size 1. We then check whether the result says that it is a digit. 
The Get­String­TypeW function produces a 16-bit value for each provided code unit. There are more than 16 things you can ask about, so they are broken into groups, and you specify which group you want. Group 1 contains the basic classifications that support POSIX functions like isdigit and isalnum. 
Here’s one way it could be done. (I’m not saying this is how it actually is done.) 


C runtime
Category flags
Win32 function


isalnum
C1_ALPHA | C1_UPPER | C1_LOWER | C1_DIGIT
IsCharAlphaNumeric sort of


isalpha
C1_ALPHA | C1_UPPER | C1_LOWER 
IsCharAlpha sort of


isblank
C1_BLANK



iscntrl
C1_CNTRL



isdigit
C1_DIGIT



isgraph
C1_ALPHA | C1_UPPER | C1_LOWER | C1_DIGIT | C1_PUNCT



islower
C1_LOWER
IsCharLower


isprint
C1_ALPHA | C1_UPPER | C1_LOWER | C1_DIGIT | C1_PUNCT | C1_BLANK



ispunct
C1_PUNCT



isspace
C1_SPACE



isupper
C1_UPPER
IsCharUpper


isxdigit
C1_XDIGIT
