        (Note: Read the puzzles in order from 1 to 6 for them to make sense.)
 Number five is an old-style riddle. 
 My first is an avatar, you are guardian of its soul. My second you must vanquish if you wish to reach your goal. My third you may injure if you slide too hard to third. My whole is a place where dead people can be heard. 
 My friend said this was the hardest of the puzzles to solve, but perhaps that’s just because she’s not used to them. 
  Answers to all puzzles will be posted tomorrow. Please do not post spoilers.
