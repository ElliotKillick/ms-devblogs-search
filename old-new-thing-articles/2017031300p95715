        A little while ago, I discussed that not all languages get translated console output. For reference, here are the languages that are fully-localized, including console output: 


Lang
Description


de-DE
German (Germany)


en-US
English (United States)


es-ES
Spanish (Spain)


fr-FR
French (France)


it-IT
Italian (Italy)


ja-JP
Japanese (Japan)


ko-KR
Korean (Korea)


pt-BR
Portuguese (Brazil)


ru-RU
Russian (Russia)


zh-CN
Chinese (China)


zh-HK
Chinese (Hong Kong)


zh-TW
Chinese (Taiwan)


The penultimate row is crossed out because support for full localization of Chinese (Hong Kong) was dropped in the Windows 10 Anniversary Update.
