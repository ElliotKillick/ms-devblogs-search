        If you open Task Manager and go to the Services tab, you may find that there are some services which appear to be exact duplicates of each other, except that there are random characters appended to them.

As I noted in passing some time ago,  some services are system-wide, and others are per-user. The ones that are system-wide have a single instance, but the ones that are per-user have a separate instance for each user. And the system appends a unique random number to the names of per-user services to keep them from colliding.
