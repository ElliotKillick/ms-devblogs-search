While having lunch with my colleagues a few days ago,
they complained that they get annoying email for all their
calendar events.


I mentioned,
“So turn off the email notifications.”


“You can do that?” they replied, incredulous.


Here’s how you do it.


First, go to
calendar.live.com
and sign in to your calendar.


In the upper right corner of the screen, click on the gear icon.

From the drop-down menu, select Options.
From the Options page, select the calendar you want to change.




    Edit your reminder and calendar settings




       Sven’s calendar
    ⇐



       Birthday calendar


In the Calendar settings, untick the checkboxes.



Notifications


Email notifications



    Get reminders for events and tasks




    Get daily agenda




And then click Save to save your changes.


My colleagues also noted
“It used to mean something when somebody remembered your birthday.
But now, everybody gets a notification on your birthday,
and you get birthday wishes from random people you haven’t talked
to in years.”
Which led to the next complaint,
“I just want to turn off the birthday calendar.”


No problem.
Go back and click on the gear icon,
and instead of selecting Options,
look under Filter Calendars and
untick the check box next to Birthday calendar.


If you have a Windows Phone,
you can remove it from your phone calendar by
opening the Calendar app,
opening the appbar,
selecting settings,
and then unticking the check box next to
Birthday calendar.
