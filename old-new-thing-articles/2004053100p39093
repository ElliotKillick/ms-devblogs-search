            After twelve years, Singapore  has relaxed its ban on chewing gum.  But not so fast.  
  Before Singaporeans think about unwrapping a pack of Wrigley’s Orbit gum  that’s just started selling here — and only in pharmacies —  they must submit their names and ID card numbers.  If they don’t, pharmacists who sell them gum could be jailed  up to two years and fined 5,000 Singapore dollars ($2,940).  
  Chewing gum, or more precisely the threat of chewing gum,  is employed in the wonderful movie  I  Not Stupid,  which I heartily recommend.  It seems to revel in the mixed feelings Singaporeans harbor  towards their own culture.  (My favorite character is the chubby kid.)
