         When foreign nationals come to work at Microsoft, the legal department gets to work with the paperwork of applying for permanent residency (colloquially known as a green card even though the cards haven’t been green for a long time). Obtaining permanent resident status in the United States takes a ridiculous amount of time, and I remember the irony when one of my colleagues finally received his green card… on his last day working at Microsoft. 
 Still, at least it arrived in time, if only barely.  :: Wendy :: received her green card  two months after she left the country.
