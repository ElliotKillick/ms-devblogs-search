         It’s that time again: Sending some link love to my colleagues. 

The          Microsoft Update Product Team     has a white paper called          Windows Update Explained     (direct download: .docx)     which goes into how Windows Update works     and how IT professionals can customize it. 
          Arvin Wu          compares Excel 2007’s limits against that of its predecessor.     Sure, you can get basically the same information     from     the          Excel specifications and limits     Web page,     but I like the historical comparison. 
          Stephen Toulouse     explains the RRDF: The          Redmond Reality Distortion Field. 
     The          Microsoft Research Machine Translation Team     explains          how mistranslations sneak into the system.     That’s one of the consequences of using          Statistical Machine Translation. 
     ::Wendy::     points out that in spite of the increased sense of panic     which has overcome the Western world over the past few years,     England          welcomes bus spotters.     See, public safety officials?     Don’t shoo away loser dorks; use them to your advantage. 
     The          Image Composite Editor     not only stiches together panoramas, it also generates     formats that can be used by          HD View     and          Silverlight Deep Zoom. 
          Deven Kampenhout     tips us off that          you can use Microsoft Expression     to make CSS-tinkering easier. 
     The          Windows Presentation Foundation SDK blog     describes          various ways applications get custom window chrome,     and how you can do it with WPF. 
          Brett Roberts          draws our attention to the use of MAVIS     (the          Microsoft Audio Visual Indexing System)     at the          Washington State Digital Archives.     MAVIS allows you to perform searches on audio files.     Okay, so right now all they have are committee meetings,     but still it’s a pretty cool use of technology. 
          The Visual C++ team     has          some C++ puzzles for you. 
          Mike Fried     expands on the same topic as          one of my previous essays:          You don’t know what you are shipping unless you know what you are not shipping. 
     Scott Olsen          debugs a crash and traces it back to a single flipped bit. 
          Jim Glass     posts a short item on          the high-tech sorters used to separate recyclables.          Longer article.          Q&A about recycling in the City of Seattle. 
          Kevin Remde’s “Full of I.T.” blog     (great name, Kevin)     reminds us that          even DHCP can be improved. 
     The          Office Sustained Engineering Blog     answers the provocative question,          Why doesn’t Office just fix all of the bugs before they ship it? 
          John Guin     gives          a real-world example of postponing a bug.     (Which, as he notes, did get fixed eventually.) 
     Robert Mitchell has a series on the          Ask the Core Team blog     on The Four Stages of File Growth:          Part 1,          Part 2,          Part 3, and          Part 4.     (The fifth stage is acceptance.) 
          John Mullinax     lets us know that          Surface devices are now available in retail     channels.     And as an extra bonus, when you buy a Surface device,          you also get a yacht attached, absolutely free. 
     On the          Microsoft Malware Protection Center team blog,     Peter Ferrie posted an interesting story about          the lengths virus writers will go to. 
          Tony Schreiner     shows how to          open Web pages in a tab in IE programmatically. 

 Updates: Fixed name of product Microsoft Expression (no “s”). Also, I think Arvin’s blog is still up—it’s just being masked by a doppelganger. Will update as information becomes available.
