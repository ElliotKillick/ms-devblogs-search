The DC brush
GetStockObject(DC_BRUSH)
is a stock brush associated with the device context.
Like

the system color brushes,
the color of the DC brush changes dynamically,
but whereas the system color brushes change color based
on the system colors, the color of the DC brush changes at your command.


The DC brush is handy when you need a solid color brush for
a very short time, since it always exists and doesn’t need to be
created or destroyed.  Normally, you have to create a solid color brush,
draw with it, then destroy it.  With the DC brush, you set its color and
start drawing.
But it works only for a short time, because the moment somebody else
calls

the SetDCBrushColor function
on your DC, the DC brush color will be overwritten.
In practice, this means that the DC brush color is not trustworthy
once you relinquish control to other code.
(Note, however, that each DC has its own DC brush color,
so you need only worry about somebody on another thread messing with
your DC simultaneously, which doesn’t happen under any of the painting models
I am familiar with.)


The DC brush is amazingly useful when handling

the various WM_CTLCOLOR messages.
These messages require you to return a brush that will be used
to draw the control background.
If you need a solid color brush, this usually means creating the
solid color brush and caching it for the lifetime of the window,
then destroying it when the window is destroyed.
(Some people cache the brush in a static variable, which works great
until somebody creates two copies of the dialog/window.
Then you get a big mess.)


Let’s use the DC brush to customize the colors of a static control.
The program is not interesting as a program; it’s just an illustration
of one way you can use the DC brush.


Start, as always, with our

scratch program, and making the following changes.


BOOL
OnCreate(HWND hwnd, LPCREATESTRUCT lpcs)
{
  g_hwndChild = CreateWindow(TEXT("static"), NULL,
        WS_VISIBLE | WS_CHILD, 0, 0, 0, 0,
        hwnd, NULL, g_hinst, 0);
 if (!g_hwndChild) return FALSE;
 return TRUE;
}
HBRUSH OnCtlColor(HWND hwnd, HDC hdc, HWND hwndChild, int type)
{
  FORWARD_WM_CTLCOLORSTATIC(hwnd, hdc, hwndChild, DefWindowProc);
  SetDCBrushColor(hdc, RGB(255,0,0));
  return GetStockBrush(DC_BRUSH);
}
    HANDLE_MSG(hwnd, WM_CTLCOLORSTATIC, OnCtlColor);


Run this program and observe that we changed the background color
of the static window to red.


The work happens inside the OnCtlColor function.
When asked to customize the colors, we first forward the message
to

the DefWindowProc function
so that the default foreground and background text colors are set.
(Not relevant here since we draw no text, but a good thing to do
on principle.)
Since we want to override the background brush color,
we set the DC brush color to red and then return the DC brush
as our desired background brush.


The static control then takes the brush we returned (the DC brush)
and uses it to draw the background, which draws in red because
that’s the color we set it to.


Normally, when customizing the background brush, we have to create
a brush, return it from the WM_CTLCOLORSTATIC message, then destroy
it when the parent window is destroyed.
But by using the DC brush, we avoided having to do all that bookkeeping.


There is also a DC pen GetStockObject(DC_PEN) which behaves
in an entirely analogous manner.
