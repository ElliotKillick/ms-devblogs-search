Here’s a little script that opens the Run dialog.
You can save it as “Run.js” and double-click it.


(new ActiveXObject("Shell.Application")).FileRun();


The advantage of this approach over various others people have come
up with is that this one is actually

documented.
(And therefore is less likely to break in the next version of the
operating system.)

            Follow
