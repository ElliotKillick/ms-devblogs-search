        This Sunday will be the Nth annual Seattle  Danskin Women’s Triathlon (for some value of N greater than 1), the largest women-only triathlon. I learned about this event last year when I saw that the express lanes on the I-90 bridge were crowded with bicyclists, and I went online to try to figure out what was going on.
 As I clicked around, I found the  Volunteer Site and was particularly impressed with the  Swim Angels. (More details.) These are strong women swimmers whose job it is to accompany the weaker swimmers and provide moral support. 
 I was chatting with a friend of mine, who noted that one of the first volunteer positions to fill is the “Help the women change out of their wetsuits in the transition area.” Go figure. 
 Best wishes to all of this weekend’s participants!
