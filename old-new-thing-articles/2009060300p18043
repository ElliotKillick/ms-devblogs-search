        If you spend time in kernel mode, you’re accustomed to seeing functions with two-letter (or occasionally, three-letter) prefixes that indicate which component they belong to.

 What does the “Zw” mean? 
 Answer: Nothing. 
 The people who chose the letters wanted to pick something that was unlikely to collide with anything. Perhaps they had a prior bad experience with having chosen a prefix, only to find that somebody ahead of them claimed it already?
