         Internet retailer woot! went to CES 2010 and covered it on  their blog. (CES category.) But they don’t cover what the media elite cover, the big announcements, the hot products. Nope, they cover the weird stuff. 
 They have  uncrating photos of CES itself, they  infiltrate the The Consumer Breakfast Buffet Show, and they take  super secret spy pictures of a miniature shopping cart.
