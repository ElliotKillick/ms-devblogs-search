        Today is the  Microsoft Giving Campaign 5K Run/Walk, which raises money in support of the  Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation,  KEXP radio,  Boys & Girls Clubs of Bellevue, and (new this year)  Plymouth Housing.
This is a fun event, not a race, and friends and family are welcome to participate. But one of my colleagues pointed out that there are some ground rules:

To ensure that this is a safe and fun event for all participants, the following are not permitted on the race course:

pets (this policy does not apply to service animals)
skateboards or rollerblades
wagons
scooters or segways
office chairs ⇐
any other items deemed potential hazards.


You can try to guess  how that fifth item got on the list.
