         I’ve just been informed by my publisher that the bonus chapters from  my book are now  available for download. Click on “Sample Chapters”. Sorry they’re late. 
 The source code for the programs in the book can be downloaded from the “Source Code” link. And on a more embarrassing note, there’s that “Errata” link, too.
