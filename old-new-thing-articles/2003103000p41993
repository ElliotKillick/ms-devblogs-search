         I had mentioned in passing in a         comment on 10/10/2003 10:07PM that one of the reasons the clock on the taskbar         isnâ€™t analog is that some disturbingly high percentage of people (30%? 40%? I forget         exactly) do not know how to read an analog clock.      
         Yet there is is in the Longhorn sidebar. What gives?      
         Ah but if you look more closely, the digital time is printed immediately below it.      
     That was our compromise.
