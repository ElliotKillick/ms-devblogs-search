  Where does the taskbar get grouped button icons from?
  The icon for grouped taskbar buttons comes from the icon for the  underlying EXE, the same icon that appears when you  open the folder that the EXE resides in and scroll down to the EXE.
  For example, if you have multiple Explorer windows  open and the taskbar buttons get grouped, the icon you get for  the grouping is the Explorer icon.  The system doesnâ€™t try to  merge all the icons for the individual windows together,  one of which might be a hard drive icon, another a Control Panel icon,  another a folder icon, etc.
