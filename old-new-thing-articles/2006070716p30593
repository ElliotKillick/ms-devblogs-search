        Back in November,  Paul Davidson popped into his local Starbucks coffee shop and ended up  in line right behind Mr. T. Unlike me, Mr. Davidson actually knew ahead of time what he was going to ask the former A-Team heavy. And the answer was worth waiting for.
 (Via  TV Squad:  Mr. T likes espresso, fool!)
 Mr. T has not disappeared from the scene entirely, however. TV Land announced [pdf] last September a new reality show starring the former A-Team heavy tentatively titled I Pity The Fool (capital “The” for some reason).  More recent coverage.
