        No, this is not my attempt to get picked up as a television show. It’s just that my father-in-law sometimes says funny stuff. 
When my mother came to visit, she brought some bread that she had made in a bread-making machine. The conversation went something like this: 
Father-in-law: “Wow, this bread is really good. Maybe we should get a bread-making machine.” 
Mom: “It’s really easy to do. You just measure the ingredients, put them in the machine, and push the button. Three hours later, you have fresh bread!” 
Father-in-law: “Three hours? After three hours I might not still be hungry!”
