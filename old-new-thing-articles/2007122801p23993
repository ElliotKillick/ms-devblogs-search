         In my mailbox yesterday arrived a few complimentary copies of  the Japanese translation of my book. (Note:  Still available in English.) I cracked the Japanese edition open and confirmed what I already knew: I can’t read a lick of Japanese. 
 But now I know how you all feel when you read this Web site: It’s page after page of text that makes no sense whatsoever.
