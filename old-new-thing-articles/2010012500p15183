Jonathan Wilson asks

why the clipboard APIs still require GlobalAlloc and friends.
Why is there not a SetClipboardDataEx
or something that does what SetClipboardData
does but without needing to call GlobalAlloc?


Okay, here’s your function:


HANDLE SetClipboardDataEx(UINT uFormat, void *pvData, DWORD cbData)
{
    if (uFormat == CF_BITMAP ||
        uFormat == CF_DSPBITMAP ||
        uFormat == CF_PALETTE ||
        uFormat == CF_METAFILEPICT ||
        uFormat == CF_DSPMETAFILEPICT ||
        uFormat == CF_ENHMETAFILE ||
        uFormat == CF_DSPENHMETAFILE ||
        uFormat == CF_OWNERDISPLAY) {
        return NULL; // these are not HGLOBAL format
    }
    HANDLE hRc = NULL;
    HGLOBAL hglob = GlobalAlloc(GMEM_MOVEABLE | GMEM_SHARE | GMEM_ZEROINIT,
                                cbData);
    if (hglob) {
        void *pvGlob = GlobalLock(hglob);
        if (pvGlob) {
            CopyMemory(pvGlob, pvData, cbData);
            GlobalUnlock(hglob);
            hRc = SetClipboardData(uFormat, hglob);
        }
        if (!hRc) {
            GlobalFree(hglob);
        }
    }
    return hRc;
}


Whoop-dee-doo.


Historically,

Windows doesn’t go out of its way to include functions like this
because you can easily write them yourself,
or you can at least find a framework library
that did it for you.
Windows focused on doing the things that only Windows could do,
providing you the building blocks with which you can create
your own programs.


Besides, the classic clipboard is so old-school.
The OLE clipboard provides a much richer interface,
where you can
generate data dynamically
(for example

as a stream)
and expose it in formats other than just a chunk of bytes.
Since SetClipboardData is old-school,
if the window manager folks had written a function like
SetClipboardDataEx,
people would instead have asked the not unreasonable question,
“Why did you bother to write a function that provides no essential new
functionality to an old interface that was supplanted over a decade ago?”
