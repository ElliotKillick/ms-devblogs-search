         Weekend America  profiles Dominic Luberto, that guy with his house so covered in Christmas lights that you’re sure it’s a fire hazard or something. 
 I like how he pulls out the classic argument stopper when challenged that his display is too much. “Whoever comes against me – listen – goes against the kids.” There you go. In the United States, all you have to do is accuse your opponent of hating children and you have instantly won the argument.
