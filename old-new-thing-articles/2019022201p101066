         For  many  years, I’ve  put  together a  little  pocket  guide  to the  Seattle  Symphony  subscription  season for my symphony friends to help them decide which ticket package they want. At some point, we may start subscribing again, but for now, we pick-and-choose individual concerts.
Here’s the at-a-glance season guide for the 2019/2020 season, still with no comments from me because it’s not worth trying to rate every piece to help my friends pick one concert. If you’re my friend and want recommendations, just call. Besides, you can probably preview nearly all of the pieces nowadays (minus the premieres) by searching on YouTube.

 Official brochure. It’s called the “1920 season” because it’s short for “2019/2020”, not because it’s the year 1920.

 Season highlights

This is Thomas Dausgaard’s inaugural season as the Seattle Symphony’s music director, taking over from Ludovic Morlot who steps down after eight seasons. Dausgaard had been the symphony’s principal guest conductor since 2014.

For those not familiar with the Seattle Symphony ticket package line-ups: Most of the ticket packages are named Masterworks nX where n is the number of concerts in the package, and the letter indicates the variation. Ticket packages have been combined if they are identical save for the day of the week. For example, 8C and 8D are the same concerts; the only difference is that 8C is for Thursday nights, while 8D is for Saturday nights. For some reason, they renamed the 5H series to 5A this year.
Notes and changes:

The 7[AB], 8[CD], and 7[EF] concert series do not overlap, so you can create your own pseudo-series by taking any two of them, or recreate the 22-concert series by taking all three.
The 13-concert series is the same as the 8[CD] and 7[EF] series combined, minus the Febuary 6 and June 25 concerts.
Composer John Adams conducts a concert of his works.
Not included above are other regular series that do not overlap with the Masterworks series: Pops, Recitals, [untitled] (contemporary music), Chamber music, Family Concerts, and Tiny Tots.
At some point, the Distinguished Artists series was dropped. I failed to note when this happened. I just remembered that there used to be one, and it’s not there any more.
For the first time in many seasons, there is no overlap between the Baroque and Wine series and the Masterworks series. Technically, this means it wouldn’t be eligible for the chart above, but I keep including them out of habit.
In June, you can binge the complete symphonies of Beethoven. Because, c’mon, you know you want to.
There are always one-off concerts scattered through the year. Of special note is a a two-concert Rach Fest covering all four piano concerti.
The Seattle Symphony  Family Connections program is still going. It provides free symphony tickets for up to two children with the purchase of an adult ticket.
