         “Worst software ever.” That was   Aaron Zupancic‘s cousin’s reaction to the fact that Windows XP was incompatible with one program originally designed for Windows 98. 
 Then again,  commenter Aargh! says “The bad code should be fixed, period. If it can’t be fixed, it breaks, too bad.” Perhaps Aargh! can send a message to Aaron’s cousin saying, “Too bad.” I’m sure that’ll placate Aaron’s cousin.
