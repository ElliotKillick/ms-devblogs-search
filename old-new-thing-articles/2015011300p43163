        In a meeting, my colleague Martyn Lovell said, “The plan is shifting and hasn’t landed anywhere yet.” 
This was generally understood to mean “The plan is shifting and the issue is not yet settled.” 
I don’t know if this is true Microspeak, or Martyn was just making up a little metaphor on the fly. But I filed it away anyway because of the interesting collision with another Microspeak use of the word landing.
