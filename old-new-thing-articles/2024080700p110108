        The Accounts­Settings­Pane.Show method shows the accounts settings pane and returns immediately. How do you know when the user has closed the pane?
If the user selects one of your commands, you get a notification in the form of the Invoked event on that command. But what if the user closes the pane without selecting anything?
Instead of using the Accounts­Settings­Pane.Show method, use the Accounts­Settings­Pane.Show­Manage­Accounts­Async method. The Show­Manage­Accounts­Async method does the same thing as Accounts­Settings­Pane.Show, except that it returns an IAsync­Action which completes when the pane is closed (for whatever reason).
(Dirty secret: Really, it’s the other way around. The Accounts­Settings­Pane.Show method just calls the Accounts­Settings­Pane.Show­Manage­Accounts­Async method. and throws away the IAsyncAction.)
