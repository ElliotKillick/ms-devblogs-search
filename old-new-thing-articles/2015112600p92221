        Here are some email messages I received from an automated system. 
October 20: “This survey must be completed no later than November 14.” 
October 31: “Reminder, this survey must be completed no later than November 14.” 
November 12: “Final reminder, this survey must be completed no later than November 14.” 
November 14: “Extension, this survey must be completed no later than November 19.” 
November 19: “Final reminder, this survey must be completed no later than November 19.” 
November 28: “This survey must be completed no later than December 16.” 
I gave in and clicked the survey link. 
The link was broken. 
I guess the people running the survey said, “Gosh, we’re getting no responses. Let’s extend the deadline.”
