        It’s been quite a while, but a winner in  the caption contest has been selected and the prize finally reached its destination. (Mostly due to procrastination on my part. Don’t blame the postal service.)
 The winner is  Scott from Australia with  his entry
 Only 5,000 more referrals until MULTIBALL 
 Even though it’s kind of low-brow, it made me laugh spontaneously.
 For his efforts, Scott wins a deluxe prize package consisting of 

          Exchange 2010 laptop skin 
I’m a PC sticker and yoyo 
Windows 7 stress ball 
Assorted logo pens (Microsoft, Xbox 360, Microsoft Office) 
TSA-approved Microsoft travel lock (so he can travel to our country     should he be so inspired) 
Miscellaneous historical items from the wayback drawer 

Windows Me pen     
Microsoft Bob lapel pin     
Microsoft 20th anniversary kazoo     
Temporary tattoos: Windows 2000, Windows 95,     OLE (who knew they even had a logo!),     Microsoft Visual Tools,     MSN,     Microsoft BackOffice. 



 Here’s Scott’s acceptance speech: 
 I’d like to thank all the letters that made the caption possible – the O, the N, the R, and especially the L – that little guy really pulled his weight. And thank you to the 1990’s, for coming up with blogs, so that I could one day win a caption contest.
