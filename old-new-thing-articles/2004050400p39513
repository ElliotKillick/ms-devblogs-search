              To protest rising gasoline prices, a group of truckers  abandoned their vehicles in the middle of the highway.  It struck me as odd that  a country that brims with anti-French rhetoric  would adopt one of their protest techniques.  
  Presumably they donâ€™t want French gasoline prices either.
