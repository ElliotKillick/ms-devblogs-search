         Mark your calendars for  the 2005 Seattle Chicken Tour, scheduled this year for July 16th. 
 Seattle Tilths Annual City Chickens and Coop Tour July 16, 2005   10 am — 4 pm $10 per family or group of four Seattles city chickens owners invite you into their backyards for a first-hand look at raising chickens. Discover the variety of breeds that might be nesting in your neighborhood, learn about raising chickens, see how families integrate chickens into their organic gardening practices, as well as the ingenious coops that shelter these chickens. You will need a car to travel on this self-guided tour of over a dozen backyard chicken broods. Bring the whole family, and your out-of-town visitors, for this unique view of Seattles backyards. 
 I am not certain whether advance registration is required, so if you’re interested, you should contact  Seattle Tilth sooner rather than later.
