A customer reported that they were having trouble creating

slim reader/writer locks
at runtime.
They simplified the issue to a short program:


#include <windows.h>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std; // this is just a quick test app
int a = 10;
// This version works
int working_version()
{
 SRWLOCK lock;
 AcquireSRWLockExclusive(&lock);
 cout<<"Acquired exclusively"<<endl;
 a++;
 ReleaseSRWLockExclusive(&lock);
}
// This one doesn't
int broken_version_1()
{
 SRWLOCK *lock = new SRWLOCK;
 AcquireSRWLockExclusive(lock);
 cout<<"Acquired exclusively"<<endl;
 a++;
 ReleaseSRWLockExclusive(lock);
 // ignore the memory leak - this is just a quick test app
}
// This one doesn't either
int broken_version_2()
{
 SRWLOCK *lock = new SRWLOCK[2];
 AcquireSRWLockExclusive(&lock[0]);
 cout<<"Acquired exclusively"<<endl;
 a++;
 ReleaseSRWLockExclusive(&lock[0]);
 // ignore the memory leak - this is just a quick test app
}
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
 switch (argv[1][0]) {
 case '0': working_version(); break;
 case '1': broken_version_1(); break;
 case '2': broken_version_2(); break;
 }
 cout<<"a="<<a<<endl;
 return 0;
}


“What is the correct way of creating an SRWLOCK
via the new operator?”


It wasn’t long before somebody noted that nowhere in the code
is the function
Initialize­SRW­Lock called.


“Oh, yeah, thanks for catching that.
It looks like one needs to initialize SRW locks which are
created via the new operator.
Otherwise it’s not required.”


No, the function is always required.
It’s just that you got lucky in the local variable case
and the initial stack garbage looks enough like an initialized SRW lock
that you don’t notice the problem.


MSDN doesn’t say
“You must initialize an SRW lock before using it”
because the statement was believed to be so obvious
that it never occurred to anybody that somebody would
think the opposite was true.
I mean, what’s the point of having an
Initialize­SRW­Lock function if initialization
is not required?
Think of it as one of the

ground rules for programming:
If an object has an initialization method,
you must initialize the object before using it.


But just to be sure, I’ve submitted a documentation change request
to add the requirement.


Bonus chatter:
A common coding pattern is to wrap the low-level C-style object
inside a C++style RAII-style object.


Bonus chatter 2:
If you’re creating a highly-concurrent system, then you should
probably put each lock on its own cache line.
