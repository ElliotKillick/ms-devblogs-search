        It seems a sure-fire way to get a lot of good comments is to write about  traffic lights or  crazy  driving, so I’m going to combine the two and write about crazy driving at traffic lights. Then my comments will set a new record.
 My friend  The Knitty Professor told me about the time the sister of one of her friends came to visit from another country. The sister was driving through the streets of Boston with my friend among the passengers, and she drove straight through a red light.
 After my friend checked that she was still alive, she pointed out politely that the traffic light they had just driven through was in fact red.
 “That’s okay,” the sister replied. “I’ll stop at the next one.”
 Update: See  a comment from the Knitty Professor herself for additional clarification.
