        I was looking up some information about the  Microsoft Partner Program, commonly abbreviated MSPP. I stumbled across an internal wiki called mspp-pvp. My first reaction upon seeing the name was, “What, it’s player versus player?”
 I got this images of the CEOs of the various partners wearing VR goggles and running around playing laser tag.
 No, it’s the  Partner Velocity Program.
