         One of my colleagues shared this valuable insight into the balance between forgiveness and permission, which he in turn learned from a high-level manager in his organization: 
 The statement that it is better to ask for forgiveness than to obtain permission is true 90% of the time. The key to success is knowing where the other 10% is.
