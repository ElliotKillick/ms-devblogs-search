        I’m embarrassed for the bad pun,¹ but the subject is serious. Two stories appeared in the two major local newspapers on the same day.

          Coffee stands experiment with “sexpresso”,     using scantily-glad baristas to lure customers.     (Taiwan has been doing this for ages,     not without controversy.) 
          Man charged for stalking, threatening barista. 

 Sure, it may have been a coincidence, but I considered it a cautionary tale. 
 Follow-ups 
 Baristas resign en masse
 when the coffee stand owner decides to adopt a provocative dress code. 
 Over a year later,  NPR picks up the story.

 ¹I’m not embarrassed for making a pun, just that it’s a bad pun. (Some people would argue that there’s no such thing as a good pun.)
