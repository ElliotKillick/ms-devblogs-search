Just because you have

the ASCII table memorized
doesn’t mean you know how sorting works.


I remember a bug filed where somebody said that the “sort”
command was sorting underscores incorrectly:


AAA__
AAAAA


this was claimed to be wrong “because underscore character
follow uppercase letters and precedes lowercase letters”.


Well perhaps it does if you think ASCII sorting is the way
sorting should be.


ASCII sorting is so last century.


The

CompareString function
describes two types of sorting, “word sort” and “string sort”.
And both of them sort punctuation before letters.
