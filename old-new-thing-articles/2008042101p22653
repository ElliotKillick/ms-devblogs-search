         Engrish, the whimsical term applied to poorly-translated or downright bizarre English used in non-English-speaking countries, is not restricted to East Asia, although the most well-known examples certainly come from there. 
 While in Lisbon, I saw someone wearing a t-shirt that said Fell the force.
