         When Baby Jesus disappears from a Nativity scene,  he might be wearing a tracking device: 
 For two consecutive years, thieves made off with the baby Jesus figurine in Wellington, a town of 60,000 in Palm Beach County, Fla. The ceramic original, donated by a local merchant, was made in Italy and worth about $1,800…  
 Last year, officials took a GPS unit normally used to track the application of mosquito spray and implanted it in the latest replacement figurine. After that one disappeared, sheriff’s deputies quickly tracked it down. 

 It’s sad that the world has come to this, but nice to know that technology is helping to make the world a slightly better place.
