        During the run-up to    Windows XP Service Pack 2 Beta in December of last year,  there was a list of five bugs that the release management  team decided were so critical that they were going to slip  the beta until those bugs got fixed.
  The third bug on the list:    Deer Hunter 4 wonâ€™t run.
  Deer Hunter has the power to stop a beta.
