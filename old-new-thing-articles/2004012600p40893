        (Forwarded to me my a friend who is apparently fascinated with David Hasselhoff.)
 David Hasselhoff says his daughters hate his music and change the channel whenever Knight Rider comes on the TV.
 Okay, I defended the Germans last week, but this one baffles even me. Do the Germans not realize that David Hasselhoff is a joke? Er war ein unbeudentender Schauspieler in einem bl√∂den Fernsehprogramm.  Ihm wurde die Schau von einem Auto gestohlen!
 (And for those who still want  their Knight Rider fix, you can check out this movie of some people who  installed remote control hydraulics in a 1982 Toyota Camry and drove it around the desert, just like the Knight Rider title sequence.)
