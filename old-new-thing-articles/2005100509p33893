        In 1999, Eric Schulman published  A Briefer History of Time, based upon his previous effort to  capture the history of the universe in 200 words. The book takes the initial 200-word summary and expands upon each phrase, surreptitiously teaching you some science among the jokes. (You can even  watch a video.)
 And then  this Hawking guy shows up and gives his book  the exact same title. What a rip-off. 
 (I’m told this Hawking guy has a lot of fans. Those who live in the Seattle area might be interested to know that  he’ll be in town in mid-November.)
