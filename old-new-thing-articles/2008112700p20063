        Last year, I sent some email to the people who run our team’s check-in validation tool asking how I could add a new rule to the validation tests. One of the members wrote back, “You do it just like this guy,” and sent me a reference to another check-in that added a validation rule.
 That other check-in was made by me. 
 But wait, it gets better. 
 That other check-in? It added the very rule I was thinking about adding.
