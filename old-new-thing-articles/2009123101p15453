         Time for the semi-annual link clearance. 

          The decade according to 9-year-olds.     (Technically the decade doesn’t end until next year,     but try convincing anybody to care.) 
     The online          Dilbert strip finder     does a full-text search on Dilbert comics,     for those times when you want to find a particular comic.     For example,          a search for minivan     quickly turns up the famous          I’m gonna write me a new minivan comic.     (Related:          Text of every Dilbert from 1995ish to 2002, plus some books.) 
     Know Your Meme     painstakingly explains whatever it is that’s taking the Internet by storm. 
          The Seattle Fire Department blog,     a mix of safety tips, special events, and coverage of     some local fires.     Sort of a user-friendly version of the          fire department incident log. 
          The Rubens Tube.     (Mythbusters version.) 
          Fantasy Kids Resort,     a Japanese indoor park for children     which is more of a fantasy for paranoid parents:     Membership requires ID, there are     security cameras everywhere,     and the play areas are filled with anti-bacterial sand. 
     Crimereports.com     lets you browse the police blotter for around 400 communities     in the United States.     The Seattle Times has          a special page for Bellevue. 
     The Wall Street Journal‘s          Number Guy     looks at          what “Kills 99.9% of germs” really means. 
     The          directed graph of language unintelligibility. 
     Setting up automatic payments is easy.          Stopping them is hard. 
          How to get on television without losing your dignity. 
     Have a shoebox, some aluminum foil, and some coaxial cable?     Then you have most of the ingredients necessary to          build a digital TV antenna. 
          How MySpace came to be and why it’s intentionally disorienting.          Facebook’s and MySpace’s audiences split along social lines. 
     Even though I have good friends on both sides of the aisle     (or perhaps because of it),          this picture never fails to crack me up. 
          How to get rid of your old cell phone. 
     WMI Explorer, one of the          SAPIEN Community Tools     is a fantastic way of explorer the WMI namespace,     so you know what to plug into          the standard WMI script template. 
     The light switch          so complicated it comes with a 42-word sticker     explaining how to use it.          I bet it won an award.     My favorite comment:     “I actually have a house full of these great switches and     I’ve been looking for these instructions.”     My solution: A standard on/off switch with a vertical slider next to it     to control brightness.     It turns out that the boolean+slider is not new;          people have been using this type of control for decades. 
          Fakes and Phonies:     The shadowy world of art forgery.          A long New York Times article     also goes into the document forgery that makes the     art forgery seem legitimate. 
     Andy Warhol was a pack rat, and          his junk pile is an archivist’s gold mine. 
     I suspect there aren’t quite so many listings on          these types of sites nowadays. 
          A working Difference Engine     is on display at the          Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California     for a limited time,     after which it will go into the private collection of     Nathan Myhrvold,     who paid for          its construction. 
          Peter J. Morris     shares with us the source code to          the infinitely profitable program.     By an amazing coincidence, I wrote this exact same program too!     (I called mine /.COM.) 
          If the roles had been reversed, this would’ve made Slashdot,     “Microsoft intentionally crashes competitors     to prevent them from implementing the same feature.”     Instead, it’s just another day in compatibility land.     (Related:          Google Apps Sync intentionally disables Windows Desktop Search.     In both cases,          the problems were ironed out.) 
     There’s still time for          eligible nonprofit organizations to request copies     of Windows 7 Professional Upgrade and Windows 7 Enterprise Upgrade. 
     You can once again drag and drop into console windows     in Windows 7 thanks to some nontrivial          retooling of how console windows are hosted. 

 And, as always, the obligatory plug for my column in  TechNet Magazine: 

          When Windows Audio Goes Haywire. 
          Cached Credentials. 
          Windows ‘Prettified’ Filenames. 
           Encoding Is Not Encrypting. 
          Tracking Shortcuts. 
          What’s in a Filename? 
          Junction Dysfunction.
