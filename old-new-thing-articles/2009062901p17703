        Some time ago, I was visiting a family with small children, and I found the two-year-old middle child with a marker in her hand suspiciously close to some fresh marks on the living room couch. The following conversation ensued:
 “Who drew on the couch?” 
 — My older sister. 
 “Your older sister isn’t home.” 
 — The baby. 
 “The baby can’t reach this.” 
 — The dog. 
 “You don’t have a dog.”
