         This is the entire text of an actual piece of email I received from a high-level manager in response to some feedback I sent. 

 Thanks. 
 There is a lot of norming around any of these mechanisms as well as a certain amount of ability to hold ones ground in these interactions in addition to the admin of the rule being good enough as discussed.
