         Bohemian Rhapsody was not part of my world growing up, so I view the continuing cultural fascination with the piece with detached confusion. 

          The Bohemian Rhapsody Project,     a movie which takes its spoken dialog exclusively from the song.     (trailer)

 The hallmark of cultural preoccupation is the fact that  the Wikipedia entry deconstructs the piece moment by moment, clocking in at over 2000 words, far in excess of the Wikipedia recommendation of a 60-word summary for a 6-minute piece (10 words per minute). And  longer than the entire Wikipedia page for Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
