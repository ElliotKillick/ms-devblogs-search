        The early design for the animation that occurs when you sign in was to take your logon wallpaper and open it up like a curtain.

This worked well for nature photos.
However, it is very common for users to put pictures of people on their logon wallpaper. The likelihood of putting a person on your logon wallpaper is strongly correlated to whether you have children.[citation needed]

It turns out that people don’t react well when they see their children’s heads cut in half.
That’s why the sign-in animation is careful not to cut the picture into pieces.
