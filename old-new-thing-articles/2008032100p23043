        Another installment in the extremely sporadic series on how to write like Raymond.
 On occasion, I’ll find myself engaged in a mail thread with a customer who refuses to believe what they’re being told and is under the impression that rephrasing the question will get a different answer.
 “My customer wants to control the name and appearance of the XYZ icon in the DEF dialog.”
 — There is no public interface for manipulating that icon.
 “Can I change the icon’s appearance?”
 — There is no public interface for manipulating that icon.
 At this point, I say to myself, “Two.” And there’s a nonzero chance that I will be rewarded with a third question:
 “What about in C++?”
  —  What I tell you three times is true. There is no public interface for manipulating that icon.
