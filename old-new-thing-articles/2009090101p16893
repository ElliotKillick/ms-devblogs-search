         Fake Steve Jobs put on the map the wonderful insanity of the fake celebrity blog. (I’m sure there were others before Fake Steve Jobs, but that’s the one that made it cool and hip.) Copycats sprung up, from  Fake Steve Ballmer to  Mock Mark Cuban, but none of them really had the staying power of good old Fake Steve Jobs.
 (movie trailer voice) Until now.
 Introducing Walt Mosspuppet, a fake video blog starring a puppet version of the technology reporter.
