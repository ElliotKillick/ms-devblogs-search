         Trying to make light (get it? light?) of the situation, there were quite a few jokes about the power outage at the PDC. The Hands-On Lab was being set up at the time the building went dark. A bunch of us speculated what the technicians must have been thinking when the power went out just as they plugged in a rack of computers… Perhaps in reaction to this, the “Frequently-Used Tasks” section of the Hands-On Labs software included a new task: Cause Power Outage. I of course couldn’t resist and clicked on it. “Shame on you!” it roared back at me.
