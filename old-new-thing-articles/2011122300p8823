A customer was having trouble obtaining information from
a shortcut file.
“Here is a sample program that tries to print the target
of a shortcut file, but it only gets the file name without
a directory.
How do I get the full path?”


 IShellLink *psl;
 ... code that loads the IShellLink omitted ...
 TCHAR szPath[MAX_PATH];
 WIN32_FIND_DATA wfd;
 hr = psl->GetPath(szPath, MAX_PATH, &wfd, SLGP_UNCPATH);
 if (SUCCEEDED(hr)) {
  _tprintf(TEXT("Got path: %s\n"), wfd.cFileName);
 }


Recall that the WIN32_FIND_DATA structure
contains only a file name in the cFile­Name member.
It doesn’t have any path information.
The WIN32_FIND_DATA structure was
originally created for the Find­First­File
function,
and you already know the directory you are searching in
because you passed it to
Find­First­File.


But we’re not using the
WIN32_FIND_DATA structure in
conjunction with
Find­First­File,
so where do I get the directory from?


In the customer’s excitement over the
WIN32_FIND_DATA structure,
they forgot about that other parameter:
szPath.

 if (SUCCEEDED(hr)) {
  _tprintf(TEXT("Got path: %s\n"), szPath);
 }

The answer was sitting right there in front of them,
like an overlooked Christmas present.


(Don’t forget, the target of the shortcut might not be a file,
in which case
the call to Get­Path will return S_FALSE.)
