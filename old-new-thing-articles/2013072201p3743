         I dreamed that I was on a business trip with two colleagues. We discussed Canadian science broadcaster David Suzuki and how in photos of him as a teenager, he looked like Elvis Presley. (Note: Not actually true as far as I know. Remember, this is a dream.) 
 Fortunately, the hotel room we booked had three beds. But if Michael Jackson hadnâ€™t canceled, then two of us would have had to double-up, and we briefly discussed who would be bunking together. Possibly my two colleagues together, or me with the first colleague, or me with the second colleague. It went without saying, however, that had Michael Jackson actually shown up, he would definitely have been be given his own bed.
