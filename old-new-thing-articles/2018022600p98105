        There was that time a team was hosting a two-day plugfest, and I was volunteered to assist them with debugging any issues in my area that may arise. 
They booked me to spend two entire days in a conference room with them. I showed up in the morning, and asked, “So how does this work?” 
They said, “People might come in at various points during the day with machines that are having problems. We try to debug the problems ourselves, but we sometimes get stuck when the issue is deep inside another team’s code, so we’d like to have you around in case that happens.” 
I replied, “Okay, how about this. I’m going back to my office. Here’s my cell phone number. If you run into trouble, call me. I’ll be here within 10 minutes.” 
They accepted my counter-offer, and I returned to my office. 
Two days passed. 
No calls. 
Best plugfest ever. 
Bonus chatter: Credit for the post title goes to one of my friends who made it up after I told the story.
