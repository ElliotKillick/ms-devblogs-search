        If you are attending a presentation, you can tell whether  the person at the lectern is a manager or a programmer  by looking at their PowerPoint presentation.
  If it’s black-and-white, all-text, multimedia-free,  and rarely has more than ten  bullet points on a page, then the presenter is probably  a programmer.
  If it’s colorful, with graphics, animation,  and pages crammed with information bordering on illegibility,  then the presenter is probably a manager.
  It’s fun watching a manager try to rewind their presentation to  a particular page.  As you step over pages, you still have to  sit through the animations, which means that instead of  “hit space five times” to go forward five pages, you have to  “hit space fifteen times, waiting three seconds between each press  of the spacebar” because each page has three animations  which you must sit through and experience again.
