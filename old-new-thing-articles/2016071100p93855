        A customer wanted to know where to get a glossary of Microsoft’s standard translations of computer terms. 
The Microsoft Language Portal has a bunch of localization resources, including 

        Interactive search 
        Terminology collection 
        Style guides 
I mentioned the style guide before, but I never linked to the other resources available on the Language Portal. 
So there you go. In case you ever wanted to know Microsoft’s standard translation of planned intercompany demand into Swedish, or whether the Microsoft style for Swedish prefers nån or något, or bli or bliva. 
(By the way, the answers are planerad koncernintern efterfrågan, något, and bli.)
