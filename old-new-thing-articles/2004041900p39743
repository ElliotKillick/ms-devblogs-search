        The New York Times reported on    two enormous construction projects of dubious merit:
    [The first bridge]  would connect [Ketchikan, population 7845]  to an island that has about 50 residents and the area’s airport,  which offers six flights a day (a few more in summer).  It could cost about $200 million.  
  The other bridge would span an inlet for nearly  two miles to tie Anchorage to a port  that has a single regular tenant and almost no homes or businesses.  It would cost up to $2 billion.  

  The first bridge replaces a five minute ferry ride  with a drive that most likely will take even longer.
  And the representative from Alaska behind these pointless  construction projects is hardly ashamed of this.  Quite the contrary:  He’s proud of his achievement.  
  “I stuffed it like a turkey.”  
  United States politics is not about trying to make the world a better  place.  It’s about doing whatever it takes to get re-elected.
