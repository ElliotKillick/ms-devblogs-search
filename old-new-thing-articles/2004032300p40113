Some people are in an uproar over IE’s

dropping of support for @ notation in HTTP URLs.
What people fail to note is that
The @ notation was never legal for HTTP URLs in the
first place.
If you go to

RFC 1738 section 3.3 (HTTP),
it explicitly states:



   An HTTP URL takes the form:

      http://<host>:<port>/<path>?<searchpart>


   where <host> and <port> are as described in Section 3.1.
   If :<port>
   is omitted, the port defaults to 80.
   No user name or password is
   allowed.



(Emphasis mine.)


So there are now three sides to the argument:


“I want Internet Explorer to be backwards-compatible with my invalid URLs.”
    (These people want the @-syntax retained.)
“I want Internet Explorer to be more secure.”
    (These people want the @-syntax removed.)
“I want Internet Explorer to be more standards-compliant.”
    (These people also want the @-syntax removed.)


Personally I think dropping support for @-notation was the
right thing to do.
