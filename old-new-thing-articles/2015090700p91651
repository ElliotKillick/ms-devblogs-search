        Microsoft provides to its employees a retirement calculator that is more detailed than the kinds you can find on the Internet. After gathering all sorts of information, including your savings and spending patterns, it draws some nice bar charts and tells you how many years you should continue working before you can retire. 
Even if I tell the calculator that I have a billion dollars in savings, it still tells me, “You should work one more year.” 
Clarifying note: I don’t actually have a billion dollars in savings.
