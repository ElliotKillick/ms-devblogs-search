         Last year, the Washington Post covered  the fates of The Thing, that Christmas impulse gift that stores place in enticing locations in the store to convince you that you simply gotta have it. The  twirling apple peeler, the  liquor carousel, the  portable chocolate fountain (for your  fancy party, no doubt). 
 After a few years, some of them show up by the garbage-bagful at the Opportunity Shop thrift store. “We get three or four fondue sets a month… Sometimes we get stuff and I don’t even know what the stuff is.”
