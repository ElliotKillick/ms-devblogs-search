         A customer asked the following question (paraphrased): 
 Does the Windows XP Add/Remove Programs control panel expose a scriptable object model? We want our program to open the Add/Remove Programs control panel and uninstall the programs of our competitors. 
 No, there is no object model for the Add and Remove Programs control panel, and it frightens me that you’re even contemplating what you’re suggesting.
