          Every Wednesday evening in August of this year, Marymoor Park will be showing a movie. Tonightâ€™s movie is Bend It Like Beckham. The movie begins at dusk, and a $5 donation is suggested, proceeds to be shared between the park and a local charity. The charity tends to be thematically related to the movie; for Beckham, for example, part of the money will go to the Lake Washington Youth Soccer Association.
