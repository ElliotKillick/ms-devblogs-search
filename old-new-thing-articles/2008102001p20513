         My friend ::Wendy:: decided that going off topic in the comments to this Web site was so much fun, she didn’t want to let the  Ground Rules stop her. So she created the  Off-Roading The Old New Thing group, where people who get a thrill out of going off topic can do so without running afoul of this Web site’s Ground Rules. 
 Have fun, everybody!
