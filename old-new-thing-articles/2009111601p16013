Step 1:
Buy a
1.55-ounce Hersheyâ€™s Milk Chocolate Bar
from a convenience store, supermarket, or (if truly desperate)

online.


Step 2:
Print out

this candy bar wrapper.


Step 3:
Trim wrapper on registration marks and wrap around candy bar.


Step 4:
Stay up late the night before you plan on watching the video
by partying with

Ryan North
and

teaching him how to play beer pong.


Step 5:
Force yourself to wake up the next morning and watch

the recorded video
of

my talk
while trying desperately to stay awake.
The candy bar might help.


Note: Although most steps are optional, they
are essential if you want an accurate simulation.
