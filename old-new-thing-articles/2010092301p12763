         One way to convince a child to try out an unfamiliar food is to say that it’s an alternate form of pizza. Here are some examples. Feel free to add more in the comments. 

Quesadilla: Mexican pizza 
Dosa: Indian pizza 
Quiche: French deep-dish pizza 

 I had originally listed crêpe as French pizza, then realized it’s more like a French pancake. (I wonder  what the Italian version of pizza would be…)
