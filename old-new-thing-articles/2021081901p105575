        One of my colleagues who pays attention to this sort of thing pointed out that Season 3 Episode 5 of the television documentary Humans demonstrates how you can take over an unattended laptop:

Administrator: C:\windows\system32\cmd.exe

Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.15063]
(c) 2017 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
 
C:\windows\system32>powershell Set-ExecutionPolicy 'Unrestricted' -Scope CurrentUser -Confirm:$false
 
C:\windows\system32>powershell.exe -File C:\Windows\config54725.ps1
 
No rules match the specified criteria.
 
 
Updated 3 rule(s).
Ok.
 
Exploit installed
 
C:\windows\system32>_
 


Apparently hackers have  graduated from Notepad and are now using PowerShell.
My colleague was pleasantly surprised that this screen shot is reasonably accurate! The first line allows all scripts to run, and the second line runs a script that from the output appears to be updating firewall rules.
The “Exploit installed” is just showing off.
Previously: There’s this documentary which showed  how to trace email via inspection of headers.

            Follow
