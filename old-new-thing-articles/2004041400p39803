          Competitive Scrabble®  is another game entirely.  For example,    here’s a game from the 2001 World Championship.  You can follow it    move-by-move,  or you can     read the game commentary.  
  The name “Stefan” you see in the commentary is  Wall Street Journal  reporter Stefan Fatsis,  author of  Word Freak:  Heartbreak, Triumph, Genius and Obsession  in the World of Competitive Scrabble Players,  a book that is on my list of “books I really want to read”.
