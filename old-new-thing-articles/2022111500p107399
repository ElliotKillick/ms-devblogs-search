        Windows lets you know when your computer’s Internet connection is limited or absent entirely. What is this sorcery?
Windows attempts to download a file from a dedicated Web server. Depending on which version of Windows, it’s http://www.msftncsi.com/ncsi.txt or http://www.msftconnecttest.com/connecttest.txt. If the download is successful and contains the correct contents, then Windows concludes that you have full Internet access.
If something goes wrong, Windows will report either limited or no Internet access, depending on what exactly went wrong.
