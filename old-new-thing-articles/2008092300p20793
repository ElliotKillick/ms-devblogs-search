         As I noted in an earlier entry of Microspeak, the real estate department here has their own weird jargon. Today’s phrase is “delivering space”: 
 Listed below is the schedule for delivery of space over the next twelve months. 
 Translation: “Listed below is the schedule for when new office space will become ready for use over the next twelve months.”
