             The Granite Curling Club is having their     annual open house today, October 18th 2003, from 2pm to 8pm. The Seattle facility     is the only dedicated curling facility in the United States west of the Rockies. Bring sweatpants, flat-soled shoes, and $5. They’ll provide the brooms and duct tape.
 I became fascinated with curling many years ago when I would run across curling tournaments on Canadian television. The only chance to see curling on television in the States is maybe if you’re lucky a match or two during the Winter Olympics.
