         Francesco (“Ces”) Marciuliano is the author of the comic strip  Sally Forth. In his blog,  Drink at Work he expounds on whatever tickles his fancy. (Warning: Includes strong language, adult situations, and political views.) Sure,  the stories on writing a cartoon are fun, especially when he  responds to feedback from readers, and he also has a long series of articles titled Comic Strip Writing 101 (example:  Comic Strip Writing 101: It’s Not All Pabst and Vicodin), but that’s not the best part. No, the best part is the conversations with his father. Here’s an except from  Conversation number two: 

 Dad: Marciulianos live much longer than average folks! Look at your Grandpa! He would still be alive today if he hadn’t died in that hospital. 
 Ces: What? 
 Dad: Y’know, from that spill he took…when he had to go to the hospital. I bet if he didn’t fall he would still be around today. 
 Ces: At age 102? 
 Dad: See? That’s what I’m talking about. Marciulianos live a long time.
