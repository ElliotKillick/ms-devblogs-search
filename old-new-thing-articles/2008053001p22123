         Mythbusters is going on the road. Well, the show isn’t actually going on the road. Just the two hosts. In Behind the Scenes at Mythbusters, they go on stage to tell stories about the myth busting process, but they won’t conduct any actual experiments or blow anything up. (And therefore the reason for going to the show is what, exactly?)

October 4, 2008, 8:00pm: Seattle 
October 5, 2008, 2:00pm: Portland 
October 19, 2008, 3:00pm: San Diego 

 Oops, the Portland people forgot to edit the ad copy. It still says “A hilarious evening with Jamie Heyneman and Adam Savage” even though the show is in the afternoon.
 Tickets for the Seattle and Portland shows go on sale today. (Fans in San Diego will have to wait until September.)
