Windows Vista includes a tiny command line utility called clip.
All it does is paste its stdin onto the clipboard.


dir | clip
echo hey | clip


For the opposite direction, I use a little perl script:


use Win32::Clipboard;
print Win32::Clipboard::GetText();


        
                

        
		
                

            
            
                
                    Raymond Chen                
                
            
            

                
        
            Follow
