        I believe it was  Marc Miller who related this story to me at the PDC. He was chatting with someone whose name badge identified him as an employee from a major high-end hotel chain. Marc joked, “Well, I think it’s obvious which hotel you’re staying at.”
 “Oh no,” the gentleman replied. “They won’t let me stay there. Too expensive.”
