        Yes, it’s another entry in the extremely sporadic series of  food products that are offenses against nature. Today it’s the incorrectly-punctuated  Bisquick Shake ‘n Pour.
 For people for whom adding a half cup of milk and one egg to two cups of  Bisquick powder is too complicated, now they’ve even dehydrated the milk and egg and pre-measured the mix, so all you need to do is add a measured amount of water. Because you know, cracking an egg is so time-consuming.
 My colleague who tips me off to all the foods that are offenses against nature let me know by email that even she, mother to a three-week-old baby, was able to somehow pull it together and measure out the milk and crack the egg. “Oh wait,” she corrected herself. “I made the pancakes from scratch.”
