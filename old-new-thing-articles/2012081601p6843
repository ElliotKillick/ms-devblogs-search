        We interrupt this program for a word from Microsoft Press.
 A few months ago, I noted that  Charles Petzold is coming back with another edition of Programming Windows, and you could have gotten in on the ground floor and  ordered your copy for only $10 which included access to all prerelease versions.
 Well, the book has reached Release Preview, which means that the sticker price has increased to $30, so if you missed your chance earlier, you can at least get your order in before it goes up to $40 on August 28 and before it reaches its final price of $50 on November 15. And as with the people who acted quickly, your $30 order includes access to the Release Preview and the Final version.
