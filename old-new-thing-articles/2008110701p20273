         My reaction to the news story about the so-called  Barbie Bandits wasn’t disbelief or shock at the crime, but rather confusion over their over-arching plan. People rob a bank and use the money to buy stuff. Dude, cut out the federal crime; just steal the stuff directly. 
 When I expressed this disbelief at the lunch table, one of my colleagues took issue with my assessment. “Oh, no, the food in state prison is awful. Federal is much better.”
