     The confusingly-named          Messenger Connect     provides interfaces to various Windows Live services,     such as          reading a user’s content on SkyDrive.     Check out the          Interactive SDK. 
     Prepare to be dazzled by the Internet as it existed in 1996:          The promotional web site for the movie Space Jam is still up!     I think they hired Geocities to design that site. 
     On the subject of Warner Brothers, here’s          a careful analysis of what could very well be the greatest     baseball game ever played.     I mean, how often do you see Einstein’s     Theory of Relativity applied to baseball? 
     On the subject of close analysis of fictional sporting events,          Deadspin applies basketball metrics to determine     the strategic lessons learned from     The Fresh Prince of Bel Air.

     Cheap amusement abounds in          Seattle Bubble‘s     redundantly-named          real actual listing photos.     (Related:     See, I fixed it.)     My favorite is the          Guess what’s amiss quiz.     Once you’ve been alerted to the issue,     you start noticing it wherever it appears.     Related:          Detrimental Listing Photos.

     Artist          R. Luke DuBois     studied the text of online personal ads from around          the country     to produce          A More Perfect Union     which (among other things) renders heat maps of the United States     based on prevalence of words in those personal ads.     I did not expect     West Virginia to be a hot spot for          kinky.     Another part of the project labels cities by the word     they use most often.     In          Washington, Seattle is Heartbreak,     Redmond is Email,     and Bellevue is Cigarette. (Cigarette?)
