        Some time ago, somebody asked a question about why, when they do 1 and 2, they get extra thing 3.
 “The extra 3 is there because of the 456 feature. BUT DO NOT DISABLE THE 456 FEATURE JUST BECAUSE YOU DON’T LIKE 3. The 456 feature is important, because it ensures that 2 runs to completion. Otherwise, you risk data loss.”
 The person wrote back, “I disabled the 456 feature, and that fixed it. Thanks!”
 It appears that that person’s monitor is broken: It doesn’t know how to render text in capital letters.
