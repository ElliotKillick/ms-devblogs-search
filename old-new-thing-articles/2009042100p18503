         I have a fancy new office telephone with a bajillion features (most of which I will never even find, much less use). The telephone comes with a helpful manual, explaining how to carry out various tasks. For example: 

 Answering a Call 
 Using the Handset: Pick up the handset. 

 Cool, I was wondering about that. 

        
                

        
		
                

            
            
                
                    Raymond Chen                
                
            
            

                
        
            Follow
