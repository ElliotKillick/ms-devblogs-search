A customer had a programming problem regarding tab stops:



I create a parent window (child of main frame) as below


// Create the popup window that holds the toolbar.
if (!CreateEx(
        WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW | WS_EX_CONTROLPARENT | WS_EX_LAYERED,
        _T("ToolbarPopupWindow"),
        _T(""),
        WS_POPUP | WS_CLIPSIBLINGS,
        0, 0, 0, 0,
        pParentWnd->GetSafeHwnd(),
        NULL))


This window hosts 2 toolbar windows.
Each toolbar window
has the WS_TABSTOP style set using
SetWindowLong.


// Set tab stop for accessibility
DWORD dwStyles = ::GetWindowLong(GetSafeHwnd(), GWL_STYLE);
::SetWindowLong(GetSafeHwnd(), GWL_STYLE, dwStyles | WS_TABSTOP);


MSDN states


WS_EX_CONTROLPARENT
Allows the user to navigate among the child windows of the window
by using the TAB key.


But I am not able to use TAB to navigate to second toolbar.
I tried handling WM_GETDLGCODE and return
DLGC_WANTTAB. But this message is not sent to parent.


I can try subclassing the toolbar to handle TAB key, but if
I do that, then what’s the point of the WS_TABSTOP
and WS_EX_CONTROLPARENT styles?



You already know how to solve this customer’s problem.
The quoted documentation comes

from the MFC documentation on extended window styles.
You may find that

the documentation in the Platform SDK to be a bit better.
Which is not unexpected,
since extended window styles are a Platform SDK
feature; MFC is merely surfacing the underlying Win32 functionality
in its own framework.


Final clue:
Look at

this old blog entry,
but come to it with a different point of view.


I used my psychic powers to solve this one.
A close reading of the description of the problem reveals
that the window in question is not part of a dialog box,
which means that the standard dialog message loop is not active.
Which means that a crucial step is missing.


Did you remember to
call IsDialogMessage in your message loop?


The customer confirmed that this was the missing step.


You are right, my window is not a dialog box.
Handling IsDialogMessage solved the issue.
