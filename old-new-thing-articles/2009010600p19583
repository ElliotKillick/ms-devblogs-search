        If things you teach are teachings, then things you learn must be learnings, right? Good Microspeak citations for this word are hard to find since the word is rarely used in a sentence; it’s just a heading in a slide presentation. I found dozens of presentations that had a slide titled Learnings from XYZ, or, for those who want to sound really fancy, Key Learnings from XYZ, but very few actual sentences. Here are two:
 Alice will send an email to Bob with regards to any learnings from the XYZ program being incented to do ABC. 
 What are our key learnings for this project? 
 There’s that word key again, along with a surprise appearance of incent. 
 And that second citation barely counts since it’s really just a prose version of the slide heading!
