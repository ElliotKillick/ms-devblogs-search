         Joe Beda stopped by my office, clutching         a stack of documents he had just had notarized, and told me, “Raymond, you should         become a notary public.”      
         “Why?”      
         “It’d be fun.”      
         “Notarizing documents is fun?”      
         “No, just being a notary public – just knowing that you had the power to notarize         documents – would be fun. Besides, you’d be good at it, since you’re such a stickler         for the rules. I wonder what the qualifications for being a notary public are, anyway.”      
         So I went and looked up the process         of becoming a notary public in the State of Washington.      
     The requirements are deceptively simple: Ability to execute the duties of a notary     public (and indeed, requirement to perform said duties upon demand), a $10,000 surety     bond, a clean criminal record, and three character references who will affirm that     I am “a person of good moral character”. That last one might be tricky.
