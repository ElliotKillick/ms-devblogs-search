         At Microsoft, you’ll hear the phrase “forcing function” and it won’t be in reference to  differential equations or to  user interface design. Rather, it means a set of circumstances that forces a decision to be made or which forces an action to be taken that previously had no hard deadline. 
 Example: “The impending Y2K threat served as a forcing function for many companies to upgrade their hardware.”
