         I dreamed that I was archiving old data. Some came off an old CP/M floppy disc. Another was an IntelliTrace debug log from the 1980â€™s. Back then, IntelliTrace recorded the history onto index cards, which were stored in trays like in a library card catalog. Made jumping back and forth really easy, but setting breakpoints was a pain.
