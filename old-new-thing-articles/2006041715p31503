         There is a new placard in our cafeteria which reads “Merchandise your food with pride”. That’s the first time I’ve seen the word “merchandise” used as a verb. 
 Here, I’ll translate that last paragraph into management speak for you: 
 The cafeteria newly signed a placard whose read is “Merchandise your food with pride”. That’s my first see of a verbed “merchandise”. 
 Earlier this year, I was chatting with a Boeing employee who mentioned that he “had to status an action item”. I have yet to see the word “status” used as a verb at Microsoft, but it’s only a matter of time.
