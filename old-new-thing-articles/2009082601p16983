         In 1987,  The Flying Karamazov Brothers performed their interpretation of Shakespeare’s A Comedy of Errors. When I watched this show (part 1,  part 2) when it first aired, it was my introduction both to the juggling team and to the play. It also reinforced my impression that Shakespeare was meant to be performed and not merely read. The jokes simply don’t work as well when you merely read them. 
 For some reason, I still remember the tiny juggling mishap in the final seconds of the show (part 2, time code 1:05:14): The actress at the far left edge of the screen (Luciana) drops a pin but covers up the mistake nicely.
