        A customer wanted to know how to hide the libraries named Public (Documents), Public Pictures, and Public Videos on all computers in their organization.
 It turns out that this is already documented in TechNet under the topic  Administrative How-to Guides (I found this page by issuing a Web search for 〈library-ms〉.) 
 The customer is specifically interested in the section titled How to Customize and Deploy Libraries. 
 I’ll let you read that Web page for the details. I’m just posting this here so that the next customer won’t burn an expensive support call on something that’s already documented on TechNet. (Though if you’re the type of customer who can’t find the answer via a Web search, then there’s a good chance you won’t find this page either…)
