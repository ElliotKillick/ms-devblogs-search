        In late 2004, I was working in my office, minding my own business. I normally keep my door open, as do most other people.
 «Knock-knock» 
 I turn around. There’s somebody at the door. 
 “Oh, nothing,” the person said. “I just wanted to look at you.” 
 I closed the door and drew my blinds. 
 What would you have done? 
 (In retrospect, I obviously should have installed a webcam and charged a membership fee.)
