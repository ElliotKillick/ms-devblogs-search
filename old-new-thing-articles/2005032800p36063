         I’m an economics geek, so of course I’m a fan of  Slate’s Moneybox column as well as The Dismal Science and most of all, Steven Landsburg’s gleefully provocative Everyday Economics. I’m also a language geek, so I’ve been quite enjoying the occasional Moneybox articles which decode CEO speak into plain English titled The CEO-English Phrase Book, thereby combine two geek topics into one.
