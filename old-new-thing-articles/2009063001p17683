         Time for the semi-annual link clearance. 

          How to rotate your Samsung Syncmaster 245BW into portrait mode. 
          Watching the global cycle of airline traffic through the day.     [via] 
          Glowing Cities Under a Nighttime Sky,     a time-lapse video shot out the window of a commercial airline.     [via] 
          The least-visited attractions in Italy.     “Until recently, many museum directors viewed visitors as a     disturbance or distraction.” 
          The hidden stairways of Queen Anne Hill.     You can          order a map for $5 (+$1.50 shipping/handling). 
          How to link to a timestamp in a YouTube video. 
          A gift     for your favorite     Mac user. 
          How much does a gigabyte weigh? 
     If you’re a customer of Waste Management in the Seattle area,     the stuff you put in the recycle bin might very well end up at          the Woodinville facility.     And as a point of useless trivia—as opposed to useful     trivia?—back when Microsoft used polystyrene     plates and cups, the collected recyclables were sent to Spokane     where they were burned to generate electricity. 
          Yoram Bauman, the stand-up economist     (mentioned          earlier),     posted another one of his routines from earlier this year     where he          discusses the financial crisis. 
     The police tip line is for providing tips to the police,          not for asking the police for tips on how to thaw a turkey. 
     The Greeters     are a group of volunteers who          take visitors on quirky tours of their home city of Paris.     It looks like          many cities have programs like this. 
     I find the television show          How It’s Made     oddly mesmerising.     Farhad Manjoo          investigates why. 

 And, as always, the obligatory plug for my column in  TechNet Magazine: 

          Last Check-In Chicken.     The story begins with          Larry Osterman’s description of the “game”.     Then comes          losing the game twice in a row.     That TechNet article is the next step in the series,     which explains why you often see the same people win over and over,     and it’s not because they’re bad developers. 
          The Case of the Disappearing Cursor. 
          The Forgotten Hotkey.     How an ancient hotkey from 1983 can save you. 
          Forcing Handles Closed.     Why forcing a handle closed is another name for     “corrupt my hard drive”. 
          Finding the Right Volume. 
          When Windows Audio Goes Haywire.
