        Nothing.
 Those fields in the IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER structure are meaningful only when they appear in the EXE. The values provided in DLLs are ignored.
 Size­Of­Heap­Reserve and Size­Of­Heap­Commit fall into the same category. In general, flags and fields which control process settings have no effect when declared in a DLL. We’ve seen a few examples already, like the  /LARGE­ADDRESS­AWARE flag or the  markers which indicate the default layout direction.
