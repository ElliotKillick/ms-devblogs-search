        Some time ago,  Gray Knowlton wrote an article on  how to present to an executive.
 As you might have guessed, I’ve done it  completely the wrong way.
 Many years ago, I was part of a group presenting to a senior-level executive. I was the one who wrote the document establishing the background for the topic and laying out the various options with their pros and cons. I wasn’t the one doing the actual presenting, but I was asked to attend anyway, just in case the senior executive had a question that the presenters couldn’t answer.
 For the duration of the meeting, I sat in the back and knitted.
 As it turns out, I wasn’t needed. But at least I got some knitting done.
 (I was commended for the quality of the document I had written, so don’t think I was just blowing off the issue entirely.)
