         In one of my mathematics classes, the professor noted (and freely admitted that the joke was not original with him), “There are essentially two groups of mathematicians: Those that have read Weyl and those that have not. And once you enter the first group, you will never be understood by anyone in the second group.” 
 I guess it’s only funny to mathematicians.
