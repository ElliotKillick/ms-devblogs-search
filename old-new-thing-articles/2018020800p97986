        The  Co­Get­Apartment­Type function returns two pieces of information, documented as follows:

APT­TYPE enumeration value that specifies the type of the current apartment.
APT­TYPE­QUALIFIER enumeration value that specifies the type qualifier of the current apartment.

The possible combinations can be deduced from the documentation for APT­TYPE­QUALIFIER, but here they are in table form because people like tables.
