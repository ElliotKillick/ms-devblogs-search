        This is another special case of  Don’t forget to ask your question, indeed an even more extreme case of  Making some statements and asking for advice isn’t a question.

 Nostalgia is not a question, and it isn’t  actionable.
 What is your question? Do you want an explanation of why it changed? Are you looking for a way to change it back? Are you just reminiscing? Or maybe you’re congratulating the design team for simplifying the task?
