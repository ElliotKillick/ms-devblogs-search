        Back in 1944, LIFE Magazine ran a series of photos showing some of the hand signals used by club owner Sherman Billingsley to communicate with his staff while he schmoozed with a customer. 
In a similar vein, the general manager of Eleven Madison Park  demonstrates some hand signals used in his fancy restaurant. 
Iâ€™m fascinated by hand signals and more generally the mechanisms by which complex processes are coordinated, particularly the subtle mechanisms that customers never notice. 
For example, when I visit a casino, I like to hang out near the craps table, not because I enjoy the game itself, but because I enjoy watching how the people who manage the table keep track of dozens of bets simultaneously. 
Bonus reading: The secret codes used in fancy restaurants, the mechanics of Fashion Week, and how the Queen signals her attendants at social events.
