          Marketplace covers  the businesses who are indirect beneficiaries of the Wall Street bonus season. Ted Fisher, who sells custom-tailored clothing, sees 35 to 40% of his business come in during the three months of bonus season. I suspect business near Redmond are similarly affected by Microsoft review season, though perhaps not as much now as before.
