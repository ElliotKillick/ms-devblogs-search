        Here are some terms that appear in bug reports. 

“Empty” means     “There are a bunch of things here, but not the ones I wanted.”
“Blank” means     “There are things, maybe.”
“The picture is wrong” can mean practically anything,     including possibly “The picture is right.”
“It didn’t work” can also mean practically anything,     including possibly “It worked.”

One of my colleagues works on video drivers. He pointed out that when there’s a bug of the form “… and then I get a black screen,” there’s a decent probability that the bug will include a screen shot. 
You can imagine what the screen shot looks like. 
At least it compresses well.
