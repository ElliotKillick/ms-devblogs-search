        Back in the late 1990s, some large Internet association conducted a survey in order to bestow awards in categories like Best Web server and Best Web browser, and one of the categories was Best Web authoring tool.
 We didn’t find out about this until the organization contacted the Windows team and said, “Hi, we would like to present Microsoft with the award for Best Web authoring tool. Please let us know who the author of Notepad is, so that we can invite them to the award ceremony.”
 Yup, Notepad won the award for Best Web authoring tool.
 The mail went out to the team. “Hey, does anybody remember who wrote Notepad?”
 Even a decade ago, the original authorship of Notepad was lost to the mists of time. I think the person who ended up going was the original author of the multi-line edit control, since that’s where the guts of Notepad lie.
