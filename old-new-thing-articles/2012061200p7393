         It is not uncommon for a product team to  produce some custom soda cans (really, carbonated water) for distribution at Microsoft cafeterias. Last year, the Microsoft Dynamics™ CRM 2011 team put some custom cans of sparkling water in the coolers extoling the virtues of their new product. It took the form of a side-by-side feature comparison.

 They didn’t stop at soda cans. They also branded the napkin dispensers. (The napkin dispensers have a clear panel in which a message can be inserted.)
