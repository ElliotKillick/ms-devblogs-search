          David Vronay writes about  the difficult balance that has to be maintained between people who like the classic Windows game Minesweeper and people who are (understandably) upset that Windows includes a game about landmines, trivializing a very serious issue. (Yes, the image used in the game is a water mine, not a land mine, but that’s scant consolation.) 
 By the way, David, you see, the idea behind “Find the Flowers” is that it’s bad to step on flowers.
