         “Why can’t I remove ‘for test/evaluation purposes only’? I know I’m running an evaluation         edition, I don’t need it rubbed in my face.”      
         This prevents unscrupulous OEMs from selling machines with the evaluation edition         of the product instead of the retail version. (Yes, this has happened before. Many         times.)      
         The “For test purposes only” tag prevents unscrupulous OEMs from selling machines         with uncertified drivers. (Driver-cheating has been a big problem, especially video         drivers, since… well… forever. Those of you who are gamers know all about driver         cheating.) To install an uncertified driver without a warning prompt, you need to         install the test root certificate. The presence of the test root certificate causes         the “For test purposes only” tag to appear.      
         We have also had many cases of corporate customers (and technology reporters!) who         have had machines expire because they had forgotten that they were running the evaluation         edition.  When the machines expire on them, they are stuck with thousands         of machines that don’t work. This makes them extremely upset.
