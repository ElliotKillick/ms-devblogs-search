         The Seattle Symphony made a large number of changes to their 2009/2010 program line-up. Iâ€™ve updated  the 2009/2010 Seattle Symphony subscription season at a glance accordingly. 
 The Brahms Variations on a Theme by Hadyn, the Brahms/Schoenberg Piano Quartet in g minor, and the Shostakovich Symphony #15 moved to different dates, and a large number of substitutions or single-piece additions/subtractions were made. The concert for the week of October 30 was cancelled outright; ticket-holders will be issued tickets for the week of May 6 instead.
