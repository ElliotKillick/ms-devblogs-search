        I’m watching a training video and it starts off with patently unrealistic dialog.
 I’m struggling with X. Maybe you can help me out with a different perspective, or some information that I’m not aware of. 
 An opening line like that pretty much demands bad acting. You can tell that this dialogue was designed by a committee. Nobody actually talks like this.
 Well, that’s perhaps too much of a blanket statement. Maybe people talk like this at the training company that produced the video.
