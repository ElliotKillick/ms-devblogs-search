        If you find yourself in a meeting with a mix of managers  and programmers, here’s one way to tell the difference  between them:  Look at what they brough to the meeting.
  Did they bring a laptop computer?  Score bonus points if the laptop computer is actually  turned on  during the meeting or if the laptop is special  in some way (e.g., it has a wireless card or it’s a Tablet PC).  If so, then that person is probably a manager.
  Did they come to the meeting empty-handed or with a spiral-bound  notebook?  If so, then that person is probably a programmer.
  It’s not an infallible test, but it works with surprisingly  high accuracy.
