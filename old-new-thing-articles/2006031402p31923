         On MSDN, there’s a series of articles on  the top ten things to do to make your application a Vista application. The series began last December, and just this month, they covered a topic dear to my heart:  Application compatibility. 
 [Update 2pm: If you have feedback about these articles, posting that feedback here won’t accomplish much since I am not the author of those articles.]
