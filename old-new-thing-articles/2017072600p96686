        No original content today. Just links to some CLR trivia. 

        Why is the suffix for Decimal literal constants M     (Hint: It’s not because it stands for Money.) 
        Why doesn’t the CLR complain if I use more stack than declared? 

This concludes CLR week-and-half 2017. Sorry for wasting your time.
