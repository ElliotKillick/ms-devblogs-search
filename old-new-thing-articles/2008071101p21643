        At the lunch table some time ago, we considered the possibility of riding the  STP atop a classic  ice cream bicycle. You could  play the music and cruise down the road, selling ice cream sandwiches out of your trunk.
 Naturally, you’d start really early in the day, because you can’t go very fast on that bicycle, and besides, nobody is going to want ice cream early in the morning, so you may as well get a head start on them. Ideally, they would catch up to you around mid-afternoon, during the hot part of the day when they’re looking for a break. 
 No idea how practical this is, it was just a crazy idea. 
 (Apparently we’re  not the first people to come up with this crazy idea.) 
 The STP takes place this weekend. I wish all the riders a safe and enjoyable journey. 
 Bonus shout-out: Among those riders is one of my lunchmates.  Read his story here.
