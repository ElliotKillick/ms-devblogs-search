        I walked past a woman in the grocery store who was talking on her mobile phone. I only caught one sentence. She said, in an annoyed voice, “Shrimp is not vegetables.”
 (Then again,  purple is a fruit, so anything’s possible.) 
 Update:  manicmarc correctly deduced that the tone and body language of the person on the phone indicated that her previous sentence in the conversation was something like “What vegetables do you want to have with dinner?”
