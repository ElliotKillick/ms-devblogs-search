        Behold, the latest in high fashion. The Moncler 1 Pierpaolo Piccioli down-quilted long buffer dress. It could be yours for only $2700. Add the cape for only $3565. 
I like how the white one is in the “All Seasons” category. 
I’m sure it looks better after you unpack it from the bubble wrap. 
Go ahead, make up your own joke.
