The main Microsoft campus has been

blanketed
in

snow
the past few days.
Microsoft Real Estate and Facilities has been sending out
emergency alerts regarding the state of the campus,
what services are available, what services are reduced,
that sort of thing.
Our friends over in

the Fargo campus
are generally unimpressed
by all this hubbub and have written up their own adverse
weather notification to make fun of us wusses in Redmond.
(Reprinted below with some editing.)

Campus Services


Reception:
Building lobbies will be open.
If your building reception is closed then they will be fired.


Shuttle:
Campus shuttles will not be operating
because there is no such thing as a campus shuttle in Fargo.


Mailing Services:
Mailing Services will be operating under full service.


Food Service:
There will full menu service available in all buildings.


Facilities Maintenance Response:
A full maintenance staff is at work on campus today.


Building Services:
All services such as heat,
lighting and network connectivity will be operational.


Other Advisory Notes:


Security:
Corporate Security advises its services will
remain available to the campus.
If you need assistance, stop by the office and wake them up.


Parking:
Park as usual, the snow plow drivers will just plow around you.
You’re all capable of driving on snow/ice so plowing will be limited.


Connectivity:
You shouldn’t have any connectivity issues because
you’re expected to be at work.
We only had 10″ of snow and 40mph wind.


Microsoft Company Store:
The Company store will not be open today
because the Fargo Campus doesn’t have a company store.


Area Roads:
In light of the continuing snowfall and icy road conditions,
most local roads are snow-covered and slippery
and will remain that way until March.
For information on current road conditions,
please look out the window.


Weather Updates:
For information on how the weather is impacting Microsoft
services and accessibility, please visit
http://www.youtube.com
regularly throughout the day or tune into your
local news stations for updates
when you are in the office as conditions on campus could
quickly change but they probably
won’t since cold, snow, and ice is the
normal conditions this time of year.



Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.
