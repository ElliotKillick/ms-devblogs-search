        We had  Best of Craig’s List.
 We had  Lamebook.
 Now we have  Tweeting Too Hard, “where self-important tweets get the recognition they deserve.”
 Examples: 
 The people who say I’m arrogant and shallow don’t see me when I’m at home with my wife.  Did I mention that she’s a former swimsuit model? 
 How was it I got invite to last yrs White House Xmas party when Bush was prez; and nothing this year?  I guess I must try harder 2 be fab.
