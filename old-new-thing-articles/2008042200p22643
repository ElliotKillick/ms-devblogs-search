        I was installing a program and its setup wizard said, and I am not making this up,
 Click Finish to begin installation. 
 But wait, the weirdness doesn’t end there. After you click Finish, the program installation completes, and then you get another page that tells you to click Close.
 This is misuse of the Finish button. Finish does not mean Almost finished. If the user clicks the Finish button, that’s it. No more wizard pages. It’s finished.
 The last two wizard pages should have read 
 Click Next to begin installation. 
 You have successfully installed LitWare 2.0. To close this wizard, click Finish.
