        For many years, I’ve put together a little pocket guide to the Seattle Symphony subscription season for my symphony friends to help them decide which ticket package they want. For the past several years now, we haven’t ordered any tickets at all because we all have young children, but I still make this guide out of some sense of obligation. 
So here’s the at-a-glance season guide for the 2015/2016 season anyway, again with no comments from me because nobody I know is going to use them to decide which tickets to order. Besides, you can probably preview nearly all of the pieces nowadays (minus the premieres) by searching on YouTube. 
Here is the official brochure for those who want to read the details, and you can see what The Seattle Times thinks of it. 
 function filter(c) {  var rows = document.getElementById(“schedule”).getElementsByTagName(“TR”);  for (var i = 0; i != rows.length; i++) {   var row = rows[i];   var className = row.className;   if (className != “”) {    if (c == ‘all’ || className.indexOf(c) >= 0) {     row.style.display = “”;    } else {     row.style.display = “none”;    }   }  } }

For those not familiar with the Seattle Symphony ticket package line-ups: Most of the ticket packages are named Masterworks nX where n is the number is the number of concerts in the package, and the letter indicates the variation. Ticket packages have been combined if they are identical save for the day of the week. For example, 7C and 7D are the same concerts; the only difference is that 7C is for Thursday nights, while 7D is for Saturday nights. 
This chart doesn’t include concert series such as the Distinguished Artists series which share no concerts with any of the Masterworks concerts. 
Notes and changes: 

The 7[AB], 7[CD], and 7[EF] concert series do not overlap,     so you can create your own 14-concert series     by taking any two of them,     or recreate the 21-concert series by taking all three. 
The 13-concert series is the same as the 7[CD]     and 7[EF] series combined, minus the     June 9 concert. 
The non-Masterworks series line-up continues to be tweaked:     Gone are     the Mozart series and the     The Sunday Untuxed short concerts for families.     Two children’s series were renamed but otherwise unchanged:     Discover Music became Family Concerts,     and Soundbridge Presents became Symphony Kids. 
The long-time     Wolfgang club, which targeted adults under age 40,     and its accompanying series     appear to be gone. 
A Shakespeare-themed concert in April commemorates the     400th anniversary of his death. 

This is the first season of a two-season cycle of Beethoven symphonies and piano concerti. Although there are no ticket packages specifically for the Beethoven concerts, tickets are available individually so you can make your own festival.
