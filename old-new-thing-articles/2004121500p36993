        Is there nothing a Game Boy can’t do? We already learned that  it can be played like a musical instrument. Now we discover that  letting children play with a Game Boy before surgery is more effective than tranquilizers or a parent’s hand at keeping them calm.
 You know  when you go to the dentist and she asks you, “What flavor fluoride rinse would you like?” Perhaps someday the anaesthetist will ask you, “Do you want a Game Boy or a Nintendo?”
