        On occasion, I make a typo and get “JavaScript error: Semicolon expected” and I chuckle a little, because JavaScript was designed to  make semicolons optional most of the time.
When I made this observation, some of my friends were amused because I included the phrase “JavaScript was designed.”
 JavaScript was announced 25 years ago today. Happy birthday.
Bonus chatter: If you came here looking for an actual answer, here are  some causes for the “Semicolon expected” error.
