        A few years ago,  Michael Kaplan opined on his distaste for office moves, particular the ones for which  there appears to be very little benefit. One of his options was “interview with whatever group moves into Building 24 and work for them instead.”
 Many years ago, an organizational change to the project I was working on resulted in my group ceasing to exist. The reason isn’t important to the story; what’s important is that the members of that group were redeployed to other parts of the project. At the time, I hadn’t yet learned that  material goods are a burden, and I dreaded moving offices because of all the packing and unpacking I would have to do.
 Solution: Join whatever group was moving into my hallway on the condition that I get to keep my office.
 They gladly accepted the terms of this agreement.
