         If you missed it on Saturday and Sunday night, you have a few more chances left. Set your DVR to record  Seattle Symphony from Benaroya Hall: Brahms, Kernis and Kod√°ly on one of its handful of repeat airings this week (the next one is tonight at 6pm on KCTS-HD). According to  the story in the Seattle Times, it includes close-ups of nearly every member of the orchestra so you can watch their fingerwork or their facial expressions, plus a behind-the-scenes cam so you can finally find out what the conductor and soloist are doing when they step backstage during the curtain calls.
