         NPR’s  Only a Game recently covered the rise of  adult dodgeball. At MSN‘s  tenth birthday party last week, there was a wide variety of entertainment options, the highlight of which appeared to be an organized dodgeball tournament. It was very well attended and didn’t have the ego-damaging overtones you got from elementary school. A good time was had by all. 
 The  Senior Vice President of MSN happens also to have been the   development manager of Windows 95, so he made the generous gesture of inviting the members of the Windows 95 team to his group’s birthday party. (Since the remaining members of the Windows 95 team are outnumbered forty-to-one by the current members of the MSN team, it gave the impression that Windows 95 was merely an after-thought to MSN! “Ten years ago, MSN 1.0 went live! And if I recall correctly, some little operating system rode our coattails.”)
