        Since my original article explaining  how to get Windows Media Player to single-step a video, I’ve learned that there’s an even easier way.

Pause the video. 
To single-step forward, Ctrl+Click the Play button. 
To single-step backwrd, Ctrl+Shift+Click the Play button. 

 Backward-stepping is dependent upon the codec; some of them will go backward to the previous keyframe.
