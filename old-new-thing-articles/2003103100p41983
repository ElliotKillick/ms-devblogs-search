         Often people will say, “Oh, we can highlight by inverting the color.”      
         This may have worked great on two-color black-and-white displays, but in the world         of 32-bit color this no longer is effective.      
         Consider the following picture. See if you can guess which one is inverted.      




 


 



One
Two



         Answer: The one on the right is inverted.      
         The background color is gray, #808080. The box labelled “two” is highlighted by inversion.         The inverse of #808080 is #7F7F7F, which is practically the same color.      
     Even if your eyes happen to be good enough to spot the difference, it’s still not     a very obvious difference.
