        My colleague Erin Dallin remarked, “I just installed a new toilet as part of my bathroom remodel. I was told that it is capable of  flushing 20 golf balls using only 1.6 gallons of water. I’d love to know how this standard was developed.”
  Visit the product Web site and click on Flushing system in action to watch the video. Or  read Wired‘s coverage of flush technology.
 “I also suspect that someday I’ll finally break down and verify just how many golf balls I can flush.”
