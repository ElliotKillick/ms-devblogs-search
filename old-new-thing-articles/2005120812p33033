         NPR‘s On the Media covers  the world of the fake news interview, the leading example of which in the United States is The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. Despite what you may think, the people interviewed by the likes of Ed Helms and Samantha Bee actually know that they’re being interviewed by a fake news show and go along with it anyway.
 But that doesn’t mean that they know what’s coming. 
 In a related story,  MSNBC looks at what happens to some of those interviewees after the episode airs.
