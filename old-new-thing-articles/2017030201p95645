        I was a speaker at an internal Microsoft conference for field technical people, I offered my attendee party ticket to my team because I was unable to attend myself. My instructions to the person who got the ticket were “Take pictures.” In retrospect, I should have been more specific, because he is a Millennial, and the pictures we got were of his plates of food.
