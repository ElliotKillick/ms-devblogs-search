         This term is used outside Microsoft as well, but it still bothers me. The value proposition is the benefit that the end-user gets from your product, the thing that convinces them to buy it. What makes it even more annoying is when it is abbreviated to value prop. 
 Sample usage: “The main value proposition of this model is that it permits changes to be tracked without imposing a significant burden upon the editors.”
