         When two of my friends were getting married (to each other), there was of course a lot of effort spent on finding the right wedding location. To relieve the tension, when we got together, we would amuse ourselves by coming up with guerilla wedding locations, which was our term for surreptitiously holding a wedding ceremony at a location without the site owner’s knowledge. Everybody would converge on the designated location, wait for the secret signal, and then spontaneously assemble for a wedding ceremony, wrapping it all up before anybody else knew what happened. Here are some ideas in the Seattle area we came up with: 

     A Seattle ferry.     (Oops,          turns out this is normal!) 
A Metro express bus. 
The          top floor     of          Lincoln Square.     (Reception to be held on floor 27.)     Though apparently          the Bravern cafeterias are even more amazing. 
The          viewing pavilion of the Groundcover Garden     at          Bellevue Botanical Garden. 

 Even now, with the wedding planning a dim memory, when we find a particularly nice location, we still find ourselves turning to each other and saying, “guerilla wedding.”
