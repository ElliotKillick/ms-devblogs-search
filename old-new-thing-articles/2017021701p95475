        In 2010, the world was amazed at the traffic-straddling bus, whose inventors announced plans to begin work “as soon as 2011”. 
And then the world forgot about this invention that left them so breathless just moments ago. 
And then, in 2016, the world was amazed at the traffic-straddling bus, which conceded that it currently just runs “back and forth on a short, straight stretch of road.” 
And then the world forgot about this invention that left them so breathless just moments ago. 
Well, it turns out that the traffic-straddling bus is sitting abandoned over half of a four-lane road. Shortly after the announcement in 2016, the company was accused of swindling its investors. The company stopped answering the phone. The office doors are locked. 
I wonder if the world will be amazed by their next promotional video.
