Consider this simple function:


void Reminder(HWND hwnd)
{
    MessageBoxW(nullptr,
        L"Please print out this form in triplicate "
        L"and bring it to the assistance desk "
        L"on level 2.",
        L"Reminder", MB_OK);
}


Depending on your screen resolution and font choices, this may
end up displaying like this:




    Reminder
    
      
        
      
    
    
      
        
      
    
  



        Please print out this form in triplicate
        and bring it to the assistance desk on level2.
  



    OK
  



That line break was awfully unfortunate,
stranding the number 2 on a line by itself.
(In publishingspeak, this is known as a orphan.)


You can’t control

where the Message­Box function will insert line breaks,
but you can try to influence it with the use of Unicode formatting characters.
Here, we can change the space before the 2 to a Unicode
non-breaking space, U+00A0.


void Reminder(HWND hwnd)
{
    MessageBoxW(nullptr,
        L"Please print out this form in triplicate "
        L"and bring it to the assistance desk "
        L"on level" L"\u00A0" L"2.",
        // could also have been written
        // L"on level\u00A02.",
        // but is harder to read
        L"Reminder", MB_OK);
}


The result is slightly less awful.




    Reminder
    
      
        
      
    
    
      
        
      
    
  



        Please print out this form in triplicate
        and bring it to the assistance desk onlevel 2.
  



    OK
  



Unfortunately,
I haven’t had much luck with

the soft hyphen,
but the zero-width space seems to work.


    MessageBoxW(nullptr,
        L"Gooooooo\u200Booooooo\u200Booooooo\u200Booooooo\u200B"
        L"ooooooo\u200Booooooo\u200Booooooo\u200Booooooo\u200B"
        L"ooooooo\u200Booooooo\u200Booooooo\u200Booooooo\u200B"
        L"ooooooo\u200Booooooo\u200Booooooo\u200Booooooo\u200B"
        L"ooooooo\u200Bal!",
        L"Gentle reminder", MB_OK);
