        If you use an unqualified name in a Windows Runtime IDL file, it is looked up in the current namespace. If you need a name from another namespace, you need to provide its full name.
namespace Contoso.Widgets
{
  runtimeclass Widget
  {
    Windows.Foundation.Collections.IVectorView<String> GetNames();
  }
}

There is an exception to this rule: If a parameterized type is given without a namespace, then the Windows Runtime IDL compiler will look in the Windows.Foundation.Collections namespace before giving up. In practice, this means that you can use the following shorthand:



Shorthand
Expands to


IIterable<T>
Windows.Foundation.Collections.IIterable<T>


IIterator<T>
Windows.Foundation.Collections.IIterator<T>


IKeyValuePair<K, V>
Windows.Foundation.Collections.IKeyValuePair<K, V>


IMap<K, V>
Windows.Foundation.Collections.IMap<K, V>


IMapChangedEventArgs<K>
Windows.Foundation.Collections.IMapChangedEventArgs<K>


IMapView<K, V>
Windows.Foundation.Collections.IMapView<K, V>


IObservableMap<K, V>
Windows.Foundation.Collections.IObservableMap<K, V>


IObservableVector<T>
Windows.Foundation.Collections.IObservableVector<T>


IVector<T>
Windows.Foundation.Collections.IVector<T>


IVectorView<T>
Windows.Foundation.Collections.IVectorView<T>


MapChangedEventHandler<K, V>
Windows.Foundation.Collections.MapChangedEventHandler<K, V>


VectorChangedEventHandler<T>
Windows.Foundation.Collections.VectorChangedEventHandler<T>



Resulting in
namespace Contoso.Widgets
{
  runtimeclass Widget
  {
    IVectorView<String> GetNames();
  }
}

Unfortunately, this courtesy does not apply to the Windows.Foundation namespace. You still have to write the full name Windows.Foundation.IAsyncAction, for example.
Bonus chatter: Why does the shorthand work for Windows.Foundation.Collections but not Windows.Foundation? Simple: When the compiler was being written, nobody asked for a shorthand for the Windows.Foundation namespace.
