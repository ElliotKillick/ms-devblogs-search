         The  TechNet Magazine Podcast page has just posted their February 2007 entry, which includes an interview with little old me in the second half. I havenâ€™t listened to the whole interview yet, but what struck me immediately is that I was pretty darned punchy and goofy, whereas I think  the host was trying to take a more serious tone. Oops.
