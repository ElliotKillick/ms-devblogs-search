 I saw a laptop advertised as supporting “Wireless AC”. 
I thought to myself, “Sweet, no more power cables!” 
Unfortunately, it was not referring to wireless alternating current. It was referring to the 802.11ac wireless networking standard. 
Because of course the standard that comes after 802.11n should be called 802.11ac. 
The first few 802.11 wireless networking standard revisions have been named 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n, and 802.11ac. 
A, B, G, N, AC. 
Apparently alphabetical order is hard.
