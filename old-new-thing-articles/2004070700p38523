        If you have a minimized window and want to know where it will  go when you restore it,    the GetWindowPlacement function will tell you.  In particular, the rcNormalPosition tells you where  the window would go if it were restored (as opposed to minimized or  maximized).
  One perhaps-non-obvious flag is WPF_RESTORETOMAXIMIZED.  This flag indicates that the window is currently minimized, but if  the user selects “Restore”, it will restore to its maximized instead  of restored state.  (This may seem strange, but you see it every day without  even realizing.  Take a window and maximize it. Now minimize it.  Now click the taskbar button to re-open the window.  Notice that  it returns to its maximized state, not to its restored state.  Imagine how frustrated you would be if it returned to its restored  state instead.  You’d have to keep re-maximizing the window.)
  The GetWindowPlacement and SetWindowPlacement functions are  typically used by programs that wish to save/restore window  positioning information across runs.
  You should also be aware that  the coordinate system for window placement is  not screen coordinates, but rather  workspace coordinates.    The consequence of getting this wrong is that your window  creeps up (or to the left) over time, eventually getting itself  stuck underneath the taskbar.
