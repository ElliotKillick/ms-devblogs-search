         Yesterday, the organizers of the London 2012 Olympic Games unveiled  their official logo, and it’s officially hideous. They paid £400,000 for that? As one of my friends put it, it looks like a bunch of old people tried to imagine something that would appeal to young people. Unfortunately, they forgot that today’s young people don’t live in the 1980’s.
