        I was playing with my niece (three years old at the time of this story), and she taught me a lot about farm animals. 

You get eggs from cows and pigs. 
Cow eggs are black and taste like bananas. 
Pig eggs are blue and pink and taste like ice cream. 
Blue pig eggs taste like vanilla. 
Pink pig eggs taste like strawberry. 
According to the International Egg Commission, today is World Egg Day.
