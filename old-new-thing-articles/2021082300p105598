        The std::string_view (and wide buddy std::wstring_view) represent a contiguous sequence of characters,  not necessarily null-terminated.
One nasty gotcha in C++/WinRT is that if you try to construct a winrt::hstring from a std::wstring_view, the C++/WinRT library requires that your std::wstring_view be followed with a null terminator. If the character one past the end of the view is not a null character, then the C++/WinRT library terminates the program.
I’m not sure if std::wstring_view was the correct data type for representing “a range of characters, followed by a null terminator”, but it’s what C++/WinRT chose, and we’re stuck with it. But at least now you know the bonus null terminator requirement.
