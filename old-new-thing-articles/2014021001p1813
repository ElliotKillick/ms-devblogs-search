        I was visiting a friend of mine, and his young daughter was being unusually cranky. He explained, “Oh, she’s teething.”
 I filed that away as an excuse I could use the next time I felt cranky. “Sorry about that. I’m teething.”
 Here’s another excuse you might want to use:
 “No, I’m not drunk. I simply  lost interest in remaining upright.”
