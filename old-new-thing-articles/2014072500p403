         Some time ago, I gave  a scripting solution to the problem of obtaining the computer manufacturer and model. But what if you want to do this from C++? 
 I could translate the script into C++, or I could just point you to  Creating a WMI Application Using C++ in MSDN. In particular, one of the  WMI C++ Sample Applications does exactly what you want:  Example: Creating a WMI Application. The only things you need to do are 

change SELECT * FROM Win32_Process to            SELECT * FROM Win32_ComputerSystem, and 
change Name to Manufacturer,     and then again to Model.
