        I dreamed that I was composing a blog entry about one of my dreams, but I had to do it on a toy cash register which had been paired to my computer. It turns out that this is difficult for a number of reasons.
 For one thing, the cash register has only ten letters of the alphabet on it. You have to switch to the alternate keyboard for the rest.
 Also, there is a backspace key but no other editing keys.
 Finally, there is a key labeled ≔ which changs the formatting to multi-person mode. Okay, this doesn’t actually make typing more difficult, but it’s still something unusual.
