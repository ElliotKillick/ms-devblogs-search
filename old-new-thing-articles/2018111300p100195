        The end is near for the original Microsoft Redmond campus. The nine buildings that formed the original campus are slated for demolition to make way for a new campus redesign. The buildings are making a final farewell tour this month, and last week, former Microsoft employees were invited back for one last hurrah in Building 2. 
Not mentioned in the article is a sign posted in the front door of the building:
