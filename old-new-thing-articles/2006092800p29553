        September 30, 2006 is the first    Museum Day open to the general public.  (Apparently, previous Museum Days were limited to subscribers of  Smithsonian Magazine.)
  You will have to print out the    Museum Day Admissions Coupon  to get in.  Some restrictions apply.  Read the fine print.
  Even the  Institute for Creation  Research (an actual museum!) is getting into the act.
