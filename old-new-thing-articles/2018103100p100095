         On April 2, 1996, at the then-named Computer Game Developers Conference, Microsoft introduced DirectX 2.0 to great fanfare. And by great fanfare, I mean “ridiculous fanfare.”   Read  Jay Barnson’s account of the event. Do it.   I did not attend the party, but I did receive a surplus toga kit. I’ve donated it to  the Microsoft archives. The kit includes a fake laurel wreath, and a pouch containing DirectX coins and a few chocolate coins.   On what I presume to be the obverse of the chocolate coins is a head in profile with the message “sic itur ad astra“, which the Internet tells me translates as “Thus we go to the stars.” On the reverse it contains the ATI logo surrounded by the message “MILLIONS WILL FEEL THE POWER”.   The DirectX coins read   PAX ROMANA IV-II-MCMXCVI    The party theme Pax Romana intended to convey that  Microsoft was bringing an era of peace to the game industry by introducing a common API that targets all PC video cards, so game developers didn’t have to write custom drivers for every video card they wanted to support. (According to that article, the message was not welcomed by the game development community at the time.)  

﻿ Here’s  a closer view of the pouch and the DirectX coins, part of  this retrospective of the history of DirectX from the point of view of one of its founding members, Craig Eisler.   I hung onto this toga party kit for many years, initially thinking that maybe I could use the toga for a costume party or something, but a bout of spring cleaning convinced me to donate it to the Microsoft archives. “Never worn. Chocolate coins still uneaten. (We recommend that you consult your doctor before attempting to eat multi-decade-old chocolate coins that were stored in a garage.)”   Bonus artifact: The PAX ROMANA poster.
