I may regret this, but here’s something new: A caption contest.
One of my colleagues saw this picture on a company’s Web site.



The original caption for this picture was something like
Join our affiliate program
or
Score big with our affiliate program.
Your mission is to come up with something funnier.
Here are some ideas to get you started:


Do you have balls of steel? Maybe you can become an affiliate.
We love to flip off our affiliates.
When you become an affiliate, you’re going to get whacked around a lot.
Sooner or later you’ll end up in the hole.
We like to play games with you. Become an affiliate today!


Now it’s your turn.
Keep it friendly.
