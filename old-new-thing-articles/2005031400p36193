           The Seattle Times ran  an excellent series last week on the rise and fall of InfoSpace and its charismatic leader,  Naveen Jain, who at one point  even used the phrase “cult leader” to refer to himself.
To set the tone, and perhaps to serve as a reference while you read the series, here’s a list of reported  Infospace earnings per share (EPS), both pro-forma and following Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), as reported  in their SEC filings and  press releases, illustrated with quotes from contemporary press releases (attributed to Naveen Jain unless otherwise noted).

                  We executed flawlessly on our plan.         Our performance this quarter is a clear demonstration         of our undisputed position as a leader in providing Internet         infrastructure services.

                  This demonstrates that growth and profitability are not         mutually exclusive.  Achieving profitability two quarters         ahead of Wall Street’s expectations demonstrates the strength         of our business model.
This press release begins the policy of not even mentioning GAAP results.

                  We had a totally awesome quarter.

                  InfoSpace is now synonymous with wireless Internet services.
They did not appear to file a 10-Q with the SEC, so I couldn’t         find their contemporary GAAP EPS. A year later they claimed it         was −3¢.

                  InfoSpace is leading the convergence of the two fastest growing         industry segments in history—wireless and the         Internet—creating a new industry: the wireless Internet.

                  Today marks another historic milestone in the history of         the rapid evolution of InfoSpace.

                  This was an excellent quarter for InfoSpace,         as we continued to build upon our market leadership         in the globally-expanding wireless sector.

                  InfoSpace continues to expand its relationships         and deliver value to wireless carriers proven by         the significant revenue growth in our wireless business         and the more than 1.5 million wireless subscribers.

                  InfoSpace continues to demonstrate its strength         and ability to         generate new business and pursue favorable market opportunities.

−22¢
                  Our return to pro-forma profitability this quarter reconfirms         the strength of our business model.
I like how they’re proud that they are profitable “once you ignore         all that accounting stuff”.

                  InfoSpace’s performance this quarter underscores our continuing         success in focusing on our high growth areas of wireless and merchant.

         We are feeling better about our near and long-term prospects         and believe                  we have turned a corner in our business.
In response to the Enron scandal,         GAAP numbers are once again being reported.

                  Our team made significant progress this past year         aligning costs with revenues.
Quote comes from Jim Voelker, CEO.


 The stock underwent a 10-1 reverse split in September 2002; values have been adjusted to pre-split values for comparison purposes.
 Some boxes list two numbers. The top number is the value reported at the time of the press release. The bottom number is the value reported the following year. For example, in 1999 Q2, the press release claimed that they earned 1¢/share pro forma, but one year later, in the 2000 Q2 filing, they reported a 2¢ loss per share for 1999 Q2. [Years fixed, 10pm.] Why change the amount? Because it makes the 2000 Q2 results look better when compared to the “same period last year”. I have no idea which set of numbers (if any!) is correct.
