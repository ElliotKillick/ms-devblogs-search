         It’s that time again: Sending some link love to my colleagues. 

          Keith Combs          points us to          TCP/IP Registry Values for Microsoft Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008.     Now you too can tweak values you don’t understand. 
          Jim O’Neil     shows          how to plug OpenSearch search into Explorer and customize it a bit.          Scott Hanselman provides          a few to get you started.     Other resourceful folks have cooked up          still          more.     (Oh, and          if you want “Search the Internet” to be available from your     Start menu,     you can turn on Add Search Internet link to Start Menu     in the Group Policy Editor under     User Configuration, Administrative Templates,     Start Menu and Taskbar.) 
     Eric Lawrence takes time out from his          day blog     to post on the          Fiddler blog. 
          Andy Pennell     gives some backstory on          the secrecy behind the KIN phone announcement.     (I have a few KIN promotional items which I plan to use as a     contest giveaway. First I need a contest idea…) 
          Murray Sargent     digs into the Unicode Bidi Algorithm,     specifically          where it tends to fall down. 
          Gus Class     explains          how to report bugs in SDK documentation. 
          Paul Betts     investigates          the case of the disappearing OnLoad exception. 
     The          Group Policy Search tool on MSDN     lets you browse or search a database of group policies.     You can even install an Internet Explorer search provider     or a Windows 7 Search Connector     so you can search for group policies directly from Internet Explorer     or Explorer. 
          Chris Jackson     answers the question          What is the deal with shimming on Windows Vista 64-bit?     He also explains that          you can’t fix application compatibility problems with dialog boxes.     (Chris also          covers an application compatibility bug     that technically isn’t a compatibility bug at all     because the problem occurred even on Windows XP.     The application was          mixing colors that weren’t meant to be mixed.) 
          Volker Will     points out that          support for 32-bit applications is an optional component     in Windows Server 2008 R2 Server Core.     (Man, what a long product name.) 
          Eric Ligman     discovers that          the use of acronyms is way out of control. 
     The          WER Services blog     explains          what the three answers to “Help protect your computer and improve     Windows automatically” actually mean. 
          Chris Pendleton     noted some          special map mash-ups from the City of Seattle:          The Travelers Information Map     and          My Neighborhood Map.     (In the time since that entry was written,     Chris has          taken up posting to the Bing Maps blog.) 
          Larry Osterman     tells another story of          Last Checkin Chicken.
