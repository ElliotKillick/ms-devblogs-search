        A customer was experiencing a problem with the SHGet­Folder­Path function. Specifically, they had a program that called the function like this:
SHGetFolderPath(NULL, CSIDL_COMMON_DOCUMENTS, NULL,
                SHGFP_TYPE_CURRENT, pathBuffer);

but it failed with error 0x80070003 which is the HRESULT version of ERROR_PATH_NOT_FOUND. The error occurs only when run from a Jenkins pipeline. If they the run the program standalone, then the function succeeds and returns the expected result.
A procmon trace showed that the application tried to access the folder C:\Windows\SysWOW64\autobuild\Documents, which failed with NAME_NOT_FOUND. And that was the clue that broke things open.
The Common Documents folder defaults to %PUBLIC%\Documents. The PUBLIC environment variable’s normal value is C:\Users\Public, but when the program runs as part of a Jenkins pipeline, the environment variable is set to autobuild for some reason.
This means that when the program calls SHGet­Folder­Path and asks for CSIDL_COMMON_DOCUMENTS, the system looks for autobuild\Documents, which doesn’t exist, hence error 0x80070003: “The system cannot find the path specified.”
There are a number of environment variables that have special meaning, and you change them at your peril. You probably know about variables like windir, ProgramFiles, and TEMP, but there are quite a number of other special environment variables, and PUBLIC is one of them.
Armed with this information, the customer went back to see who was messing with the PUBLIC environment variable and try to get them to stop.
