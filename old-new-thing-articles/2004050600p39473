        If you haven’t read it yet, check out  Chris Pratley‘s    voluminous discourse on various aspects of the history of Word.  It packs more history into one entry than I do all year.
  And that was a sequel!    You can read the first half, too.
  In fact, the good stuff keeps on coming.  just read it all.
