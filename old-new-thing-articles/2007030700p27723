        The title of this entry is a bad pun on  a catchphrase from 1970s television. I apologize to those for whom the 1970s are a bad memory.
 A snippet of Microspeak that bothers me is the verb phrase “to sit in”.
 Example: “I’m in the Nosebleed group which sits in Bob Smith’s organization.”
 I think it means “to be a part of” but I’m not quite sure. Maybe it just means that they’re there temporarily until they can find a more permanent “seating assignment.”
