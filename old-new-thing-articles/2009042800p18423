        I was visiting a colleague’s office in another building and I spotted a whiteboard on which the following enigmatic bar chart was drawn. The source data for the analysis was left unspecified.

 It looks like there’s  an entire Web site devoted to profound charts like this. For example,  a graph of beer bottle distribution as a function of the number of bottles taken down and passed around. 
 When I showed this Web site to one of my friends, he responded, “Oh, great, now I’m not going to get anything done for a week and it’s all your fault.” 
 Unfortunately, the charts on graphjam appear to have diverged in recent months from the site’s original conception as a reinterpretation of music and popular culture. Now it’s just snarky charts.
