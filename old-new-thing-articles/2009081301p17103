        I was at The Museum of Flight and was waiting my turn  at the Space Shuttle landing simulator. A six-year-old settled into the control seat, and as the simulation began I heard him ask his father, “Where are the bad guys?”
 I’m pretty sure  the Space Shuttle doesn’t come with onboard missiles.
 That didn’t stop the kid from pressing the trigger on the joystick a lot, though.
 By the way, I cratered the Space Shuttle.
