          For the first time, a team of women is challenged to develop a car,  and the car they come up with requires an oil change only every  50,000 kilometers and doesn’t even have a hood, so you can’t  poke around the engine.
  To me, a car has no user-serviceable parts inside.  The only  times I have opened the hood is when somebody else said,  “Hey, let me take a look at the engine of your car.”  (I have a  Toyota Prius.)  On my previous car, the only time I opened the hood was to  check the oil.
  Sometimes the open-source folks ask, “Would you buy a car whose hood  can’t be opened?”  It looks like that a lot of people (including  me) would respond, “Yes.”
