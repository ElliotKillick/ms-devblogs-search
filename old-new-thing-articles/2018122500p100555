        Say you perform a file/folder search in Explorer and you get the results. How do you save the results? That is, save the list of files that were found. 
This is not the same as saving the query, which you can do by going to the Search tab and selecting ðŸ’¾ Save search. 
To save the results, you can select all of them, say with the âŠž Select all button, and then shift-right-click on the selection and say Copy as path. This will put all the paths on the clipboard, and you can save them wherever you like. 
Itâ€™s not exactly the most obvious thing, but itâ€™s a neat trick once you know it.
