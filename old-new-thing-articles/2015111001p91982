        A Reuters article from last week includes the sentence 
That annual regulatory filing also introduced a so-called “anti-pledging” provision that prevented further loans to company directors, executives and employees using stock as collaterol.

Now, sure, this is an article about a pharmaceutical company, so maybe “collaterol” looks like an expensive new drug. 
But still. Four authors, a contributor, two editors, and two updates later, and still nobody has fixed it.
