        A customer noticed that when the system was in a high contrast mode, some icons on the Start menu turned monochrome, whereas others retained their full colors. They wanted to know how they could get the Start menu to switch to a monochrome icon for their app when the system was in a high contrast mode.
The customer said that their program is a classic Win32 program, so its icon is declared in their .rc file. They also noticed that the apps whose Start menu icons went monochrome in high contrast mode were all UWP apps. Maybe that was a factor?
Indeed, that was a factor.
Custom icons for high contrast mode require an application manifest.  Use the “contrast” qualifier to name your high-contrast alternate form. Application manifests are required for UWP apps, which is why you see it in wide use there. You can add a manifest to your classic Win32 apps, too, by putting it in an MSIX package.
Update: It’s also possible to  attach an icon manifest to your unpackaged Win32 app.
