         It is common to see whiteboards mounted in hallways. Sometimes they have  official purposes; other times they are just placed for the convenience of hallway conversations or impromptu meetings. 
 One of the hallways near my office has a very large whiteboard, completely blank, save for one note clearly written in the corner. 
 DO NOT ERASE
