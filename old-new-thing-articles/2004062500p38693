        Post suggestions for future topics here instead of posting off-topic comments. Note that the suggestion box is emptied and read periodically so don’t be surprised if your suggestion vanishes. (Note also that I am under no obligation to accept any suggestion.)
Topics I are more inclined to cover:

Windows history (particularly the Windows 95 era).   
Windows user interface programming in Win32, and shell programming in particular.   
General programming topics (selectively).   
Issues of general interest.  
My personal hobbies.

Topics I am not inclined to cover:

The blog software itself.  You can send feedback about .Text to its author, Scott Watermasysk.   
Internet Explorer. You can try IE folks like Tony Schreiner, jeffdav, and Dave Massy.   
Visual Studio.  You can try one of the Visual Studio blogs.   
Non-software Microsoft topics, such as product support policies, marketing tactics, and hiring policy.   
Microsoft software that isn’t Windows. (Exchange, Office, …)   
Windows topics outside user interface programming. (Plug and Play, Terminal Services, Windows Messenger, Outlook Express, SQL, IIS, remoting, SOA…)   
User interface programming in anything other than Win32. (Because I know nothing about it.)   
Debugging a specific problem. (Not of general interest.)  
Legal issues.   
Predictions for the future. (What’s the title of this blog again?)
