          Martha Stewart was in town this past weekend signing her book on baking. Although I’m a Martha fan, I didn’t attend the signing because I already have  a really awesome book on baking. I’ve listed below some of the ground rules for the book signing, mixed in with some stuff I just plain made up. Your mission is to pick out which of these rules are for real and which are fake. 

Martha Stewart will sign only the baking book.     No other books or memorabilia. 
Do not make eye contact with Martha Stewart. 
Do not speak to Martha Stewart unless spoken to. 
Do not ask Martha to write anything other than her name. 
Do not take pictures of Martha Stewart. 
If Martha Stewart becomes angry, curl up into a ball     and cover your head with your hands.
