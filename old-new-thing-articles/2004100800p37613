        All geeks who enjoy cooking (and who have cable television) worship Alton Brown’s program Good Eats. It’s the cooking show for engineers.
 And recently I discovered a cooking blog that is designed for engineers, named, not surprisingly,  Cooking for Engineers. Marvel at the elegance and beauty of the recipe diagrams. I have no idea whether the dishes are any good, but the recipes themselves are works of art. 
 (And don’t miss the  analysis of orange juice shelf life.) 
 Side remark: I found it somewhat odd that many Slashdotters responded to  my spam graph of a few days ago with remarks like “This guy needs to get a hobby.” I guess they don’t consider cooking,  knitting, or studying  German,  Swedish, or  Mandarin to be valid hobbies.
