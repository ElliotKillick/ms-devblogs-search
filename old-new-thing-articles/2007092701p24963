         It’s the end of September, which means that  once again, it’s time for  Smithsonian Magazine’s annual Museum Day, so  search for a participating museum near you and  get your free admission card. 
 One of the participating museums is the  Museum of History & Industry, known to locals by its initials, MOHAI. Whenever I go past the museum and see the big MOHAI banners, I think to myself how great it would be if they opened a satellite location in, say, Renton. That museum would be called the Museum of History & Industry, Renton, or  MOHAIR for short.
