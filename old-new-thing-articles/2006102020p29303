         Say what you want about blogs, there’s still room in the world for engaging journalism, such as  Randall Sullivan’s report on that bizarro Ferarri crash that started out as a spectacular event but turned out merely to be the entry into a much more complex and intriguing world. (via BoingBoing.) 
 (Recent development:  Eriksson turns down a plea deal. Interesting that he spoke through an interpreter.)
