         There’ll be the big announcement promising a revolution in the computer industry, lots of press coverage, and then… nothing. What ever happened to these companies and products? Does anybody know? 

Infinium’s (aptly-named)          Phantom gaming console.     (Apparently it is now          on hold. Can you put something that     never existed “on hold”?)     (Oh wait,          maybe it’s gone. I can’t tell.) 
ZeoSync’s          Relational Differentiation Encoding™,     promising 100:1 lossless compression. 
SpecOps’s          David OS,     which was only          six months from completion     with commercial availability by the end of 2004. 
The Consumer Broadcast Network, which          announced its intention to place a multi-billion dollar bid for AOL.     “This is not a joke,” insists Francisco Schipperheijn.     According to          this SEC filing,     “Consumer Broadcast Network is a collection of internet domains that     are not online.” 
Ry Jones     nominates          CherryOS for inclusion on this list.     “We’re     for real,” they maintain.     Oh wait,               they gave up.     [10:30am – Link updated. Apparently he took down his original announcement     so now I have to link to a second-hand report.]
