         Michael Kaplan has probably forgotten more about Unicode than most people know. He knows about  the mysterious placement of the Won character in the Korean character set,  and the same for the Japanese Yen character,  what the invariant locale is,  why Korean text sorts strangely if you pass the NORM_IGNORENONSPACE flag, and other strange and wonderful dark corners of keyboard layouts, character sets, and collation. 
 Around Microsoft, Michael is the local authority on Unicode. It’s great that he’s sharing his deep knowledge with the rest of us. (Note: I said “local” authority. Just because he’s our main guy doesn’t mean that he’s your primary contact, too.)
