        Who knew that  Beethoven wrote ambient music?
  The people at NOTAM took Beethoven’s 9th Symphony and slowed it down  so that the entire performance takes 24 hours.  It’s actually quite nice  to listen to.  (I like  2.1 myself.)
  [Rats,  scooped by MetaFilter.  Honest, it was in my queue!  Nobody will believe me; they’ll think  I swiped it from MeFi…]
  A few months ago,    NPR covered a similar experiment with the movie Psycho.  I think it was a little less successful.
