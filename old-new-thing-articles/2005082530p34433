        Not everything related to the Windows 95 launch went well. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that a local CompUSA store found that their cash registers crashed at midnight, forcing eager customers to wait ninety minutes before the problem could be resolved. The cause: A bug in the cash register software which had lain undiscovered because the store had never stayed open past midnight before!
 And there was the  the launch of MindowsÂ 95 in Hong Kong. 
 Not one to sit by and miss out on all the attention, Apple responded with its  absolutely brilliant counter-advertisement.
