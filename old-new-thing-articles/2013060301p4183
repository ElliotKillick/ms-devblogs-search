        One night, the CD player got stuck due to a scratched disc and ended up repeating the same track over and over again. I dreamed that the song was O(n²) in length,¹ with each new verse one bar longer than the previous one, but unlike a  cumulative song,² the location of the inserted bar varied randomly from verse to verse.
 Moral of the story: Don’t use CDs that skip for falling-asleep music. 
 ¹ Also known as O(√n) in  complexity. 
 ² “However, the last two lines of every stanza starting from the second stanza onwards except for the last stanza and the last four lines of the last stanza do not match with the lyrics.” Dear Wikipedia: Could you try making even less sense?
