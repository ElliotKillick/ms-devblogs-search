        The other day, I heard the Microspeak term over-index used in the wild. It’s like birdwatching, but for words. 
In a brief interview with Redfin CEO Glenn Kelman, they talked about the significance of having Amazon headquartered in your city. 
And Amazon can take some of the wealth of Seattle or Silicon Valley and bring it to the center of the country, and that can be really good. But I think people are overindexed on Amazon. There’s going to be Apple, and then there’s going to be Dropbox, and there’s going to be Intel.  
The term here is being used in the Microspeak way: Given too much prominence in a discussion. He’s saying that people are focusing too much on Amazon and missing the other companies.
