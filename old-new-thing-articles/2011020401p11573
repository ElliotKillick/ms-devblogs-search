        The nominees for the first (annual?)  Niney Awards have been announced. The Nineys are an award which recognizes those who have had the greatest impact on the technical/developer community over the past year. Winners are selected by you, the technical/developer community.
 The winners will be announced at the  MIX11 conference in April. But before they can announce winners, they need to collect votes.
 That’s where you come in.

 Now, it so happens that among the nominees is an author of  a somewhat unsucessful book on programming (not to be confused with an author of several  successful books on programming and a  to-be-published novel) but please don’t let that distract you from voting for whoever you feel best deserves to win.
