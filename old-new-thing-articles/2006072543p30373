        While it may be true that  if you know Swedish, the world is funnier, I have to admit that my knowledge of German only served to create momentary confusion.
 When I saw the headline that  the head of BetonSports was arrested, I thought to myself, “Who the heck would have a web site devoted to sports in concrete?” That’s because the German word  Beton means “concrete” (the construction material) in English, and the German word Sport means the same as in English.
 It took me a few moments to realize that the company’s name is “Bet on Sports”.
