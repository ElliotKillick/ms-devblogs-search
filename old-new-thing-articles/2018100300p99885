        Consider the following household kitchen item: The sink saddle. It is a mat that goes over the divider in a double sink. 
Here’s what it says on the label: 
SINK SADDLETAPIS D’ÉVIERPROTECTOR DE MONTURASATTELFÖRMIGER SCHUTZ FÜR DAS SPÜLENZWISCHENSTÜCK 
That brief Ph.D. dissertation translates as “saddle-shaped protector for the sink in-between piece.” 
Not sure why they didn’t go for Spülesattel. I mean, sure, it’s not a word in the dictionary, but neither is “sink saddle”. 
Today is German Unity Day (Tag der Deutschen Einheit) the national day of Germany, celebrated on the anniversary of the 1990 reunification of Germany.
