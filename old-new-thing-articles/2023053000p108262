        Some time ago, I noted that you can use  the Profiles­Directory setting in your unattend file to move the directory that Windows uses for user profiles.
The classic documentation has been updated to emphasize that the setting should be used only in a test environment, and setting it prevents the system from being serviced or upgraded.
 A newer version of the documentation repeats the emphasis that the setting should be used only in a test environment, although it no longer blocks upgrades starting in Windows 10. However, moving the profiles directory does prevent Store apps from working. And since many parts of the system are provided in the form of Store apps, moving the profiles directory will make many parts of the system inoperable.
TL;DR: Don’t use it.
