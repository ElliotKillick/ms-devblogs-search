Today’s Little Program reports whether the
Double-click to open an item (single-click to select)
option is selected in the Folder Options dialog.
A customer wanted to know how to do this,
presumably so that their program
would respect the setting and adjust its user interface
to match.


#include <windows.h>
#include <shlobj.h>
#include <stdio.h>
BOOL IsDoubleClickToOpenEnabled()
{
 SHELLFLAGSTATE sfs;
 SHGetSettings(&sfs, SSF_DOUBLECLICKINWEBVIEW);
 return sfs.fDoubleClickInWebView;
}
int __cdecl main(int, char**)
{
 printf("Double-click is %s\n",
        IsDoubleClickToOpenEnabled() ? "enabled" : "disabled");
 return 0;
}


The flag and member name is kind of weird.
The ability to single-click to open an item was
introduced as part of the Windows Desktop Update
which came with Internet Explorer 4.
This update made Explorer more Web-like,
with single-click to activate and underlines appearing
on hover.
(This was back in the day when making everything more
Web-like was the new hotness.)


The internal name of this Explorer feature was WebView,
and that name is reflected in the flag and structure.
