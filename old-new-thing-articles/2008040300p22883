The ECHO built-in command,
how much simpler could it get?
It takes whatever you put on the command line and prints it.
And yet it’s not that simple.


For example, the ECHO must be careful not to compress
whitespace, because people will write


ECHO Some text
ECHO    Indented text
ECHO             ----     underlined


and when you execute this, the result had better be


Some text
   Indented text
            ----     underlined


and not


Some text
Indented text
---- underlined


But what if you want to echo a blank line or the word “ON” or “OFF”
or a slash and a question mark?


C:\> ECHO ON
C:\> ECHO
ECHO is on.
C:\> ECHO /?
Displays messages, or turns command-echoing on or off.
...


To force the ECHO command not to interpret its
arguments, put a dot immediately after the word “echo”:

C:\> ECHO.    ON
    ON
C:\> ECHO.
C:\> ECHO./?
/?


This is what happens when a language develops not by design but
by evolution.
It becomes filled with all sorts of strange quirks in order
to accommodate new behavior while remaining compatible with
old behavior.
Nobody actually likes the batch language; they just are used to it.
