        After you put your Windows system into Developer Mode, you have the opportunity to turn on the  Windows Device Portal Web server.
 The Windows Device Portal REST API gives you a way to control various parts of the system remotely. And the one that’s interesting for today’s topic is the REST API for  injecting artificial GPS data. After sending the REST command to enable GPS overrides, you can use subsequent REST commands to inject a specific latitude and longitude into the system’s geolocator.
Now you can test geolocation on your development machine without having to drag it on a cart around the building. On the other hand, it also means you lost one justification for needing to take a trip to a tropical island “to test that the program correctly detects a change in location to a tropical island.”
