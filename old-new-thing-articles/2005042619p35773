         Oceanographer Curtis Ebbesmeyer is a fascinating source of information. He appeared again on my local public radio station to discuss issues related to garbage floating in the ocean. For example, at the 5:05 mark, he reminds us that,  if you pull a 1920’s fire extinguisher out of the ocean, you shouldn’t drink it. 
 Other fascinating facts: 

Ten-pound bowling balls float. 
Sneakers float upside-down, and the tongue acts as a rudder, resulting in left-footed sneakers and right-footed sneakers washing up on different shores. (Beachcombers from different-footed shores occasionally meet up to try to assemble a pair.) 
There are 1939 different species of plastic ducks.
