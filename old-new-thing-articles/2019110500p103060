        According to legend, Steve Ballmer’s rental car was the most diligent employee in the world.
When he was the head of the Systems Division, Steve Ballmer had to go visit various development partners on a regular basis.
At one of the partner companies, a long-time employee there was famous for being the first to arrive at work in the morning and last to leave in the evening. That employee noticed that when he came to work in the morning, there was this car already in the parking lot. And when he left work in the evening, that car was still there. He became curious as to the identity of this new hardworking employee.
Somehow, this story reached Steve at the next partner sync meeting, and that’s when he realized that he was the mysterious hardworking employee.
What happened is that during his previous visit, he ended up leaving his rental car in the parking lot. I don’t know how it happened, but you can use your imagination. Maybe he took a taxi to the airport directly from his last meeting. Or maybe everybody went out to dinner together, and after dinner, somebody gave him a ride directly to the airport. Whatever the circumstances, the car in the parking lot was his own forgotten rental car.
