        There was a bug in an internal build of Windows (let’s call it build N) where if you were sufficiently unlucky, your screen would turn black and get stuck that way. The team responsible for the bug was busy working on a fix. They later reported that verification in their branch was successful and that the fix was awaiting (but had not received) fasttrack approval for build N + 2. 
The person who reported the problem asked, “So am I to assume that I shouldn’t install build N+1?” 
The team dryly replied, “You should if you’re really into black.”
