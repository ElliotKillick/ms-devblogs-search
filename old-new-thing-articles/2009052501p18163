         The  Seattle International Film Festival is under way, and you get only  one chance to see  Wallace and Gromit: A Matter of Loaf and Death, featuring our favorite inventor/cheese-aficionado and his trusty sidekick on their latest animated adventure. 
 Be there on Saturday morning, but please leave the Stinking Bishop at home.
