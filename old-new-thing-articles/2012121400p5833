A customer observed that all of the following code fragments
are successful in creating a toolbar common control:


// Fragment 1: Use the process instance
    // Create the toolbar.
    HWND hWndToolbar = CreateWindowEx(
        0, TOOLBARCLASSNAME, NULL,
        WS_CHILD | TBSTYLE_WRAPABLE, 0, 0, 0, 0,
        hWndParent, NULL, g_hInst, NULL);


// Fragment 2: Use the comctl32 instance
    // Create the toolbar.
    HWND hWndToolbar = CreateWindowEx(
        0, TOOLBARCLASSNAME, L"Toolbar",
        WS_CHILD | WS_VISIBLE | WS_BORDER,
        0, 0, 0, 0,
        hWndParent, NULL, HINST_COMMCTRL, NULL);


// Fragment 3: Use NULL!
    // Create the toolbar.
    HWND hWndToolbar = CreateWindowEx(
        0, TOOLBARCLASSNAME, NULL,
        WS_CHILD | WS_VISIBLE, 0, 0, 0, 0,
        hWndParent, NULL, NULL, NULL);


Furthermore, the customer observed that
Get­Class­Info(hinst, TOOLBAR­CLASS­NAME, &wc)
works regardless of whether you pass
the process instance or NULL for the hinst parameter.


First of all, what’s going on?
And second of all, which of the three methods above is most correct?


We can dispatch Fragment­3 easily, because passing
NULL as the instance handle is equivalent
to passing the process instance handle.
Therefore, whatever happens in Fragment­3 is explained by whatever
happens in Fragment 1.
(Treating a NULL instance as a synonym for
the process instance is a leftover behavior from 16-bit Windows,
so I’m going to declare it a workaround for
sloppy programming rather than a recommended practice.
If you are doing this from the process module itself, then you already
have your instance handle, so you should just use it.
And if you are doing this from a DLL, then stop doing it,
because you’re messing with with somebody else’s namespace.)


The behavior of Fragment 2 is easy to explain:
The class is registered against the comctl32
library, so naturally, if you create it from that library,
you’ll get the class.


The last case is Fragment 1:
Even though we passed the wrong instance handle, we still got
the control from comctl32.
We saw the explanation for this

some time ago:
In order to allow the common controls classes to be used
in dialog templates,
they are registered as
CS_GLOBAL­CLASS.
One could argue that this is the recommended way of creating the window,
since it allows your application to superclass a common control
by registering a private class with the same name in its own namespace.
Only if a custom version is not found in the provided instance
is the list of global classes consulted.
(I’m not saying that I’m arguing that position,
just that it is a valid position.)


Okay, so the mystery of the instance handle has been solved.
But why does
Get­Class­Info return the class
even when it’s registered against some other instance?


Because it found the class!
Get­Class­Info uses the same search algorithm
that Create­Window does,
and it tells you the class it ultimately found.
However, for compatibility reasons,
the WNDCLASS.hInstance member is (usually) a copy
of the HINSTANCE you passed to
Get­Class­Info,
regardless of where the class was ultimately found.


The reason for this is that some applications pull tricks like this:


WNDCLASS wc;
GetClassInfo(hinstApp, "something", &wc);
... edit the WNDCLASS structure ...
UnregisterClass("something", hinstApp);
RegisterClass(&wc);


Suppose that something is a global class
and suppose that the
WNDCLASS.hInstance were set to the instance
of the module that registered the global class.
The application then unregisters its private class
and registers what it thinks is a replacement private class.
But instead, it overwrites the global class.


Oops.


The compatibility fix for this is to return
hinstApp
in the WNDCLASS.hInstance
member.
That way,
these programs are tricked into registering a private class
rather than overwriting a global class.
