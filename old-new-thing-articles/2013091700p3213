        Over in the product engineering groups, we arenâ€™t often exposed to the jargon employed by our Facilities group. But once in a while, it leaks through and then we get to puzzle it out.
  Emergency Electrical Outage and Restoral 
 Due to a transformer failure, power to building NNN was shut down from 6:00am to 6:30am on MMMM-DD. 
 Occupants may need to re-energize their office equipment. 

 From what we can gather, re-energize is just a fancy way of saying turn on.
 Bonus jargon: Restoral.
