          A Georgia State University study shows that    U.S. senators have an uncanny knack for picking stocks that  outpace the overall market.  Professor Alan Ziobrowski’s analysis of senators’ financial disclosure  data found that over a period of six years,  the lawmakers outperformed the market by 12 percent.   
  Professor Ziobrowski seems convinced that this is evidence of  unethical behavior.
