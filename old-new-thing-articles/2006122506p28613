         We interrupt this religious holiday for an important commercial announcement. As a special Christmas present, my new best friends at Addison-Wesley sent me an advance copy of the dead-tree edition of my book. (Obligatory plug:  Order it from Amazon. You know I want you to.) 
 One commenter asked  whether my book would be available electronically. On the copyright page of the book (that’s the back side of the title page) there is a section titled This Book Is Safari Enabled. You can follow the instructions there to gain access to  the online edition of the book for 45 days. I’m told that the electronic edition of the book will also be available in multiple formats including PDF and something called eMobipocket, whatever that is. (The ISBN for the electronic edition is 0321491955.)
