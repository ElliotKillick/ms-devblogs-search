        Some time ago I received a message that described a situation that was “based on a reality-based scenario.”
 Wow, how many layers away from reality can you get?
 It wasn’t a real scenario.
 It wasn’t a reality-based scenario.
 It was based on a reality-based scenario.
 Then again, I’m just adding to the problem. I’m writing a message about a situation based on a reality-based scenario…
