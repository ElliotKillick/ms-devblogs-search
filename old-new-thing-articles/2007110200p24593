 Public Service Announcement This weekend marks the end of Daylight Saving Time in most parts of the United States, the first “return to standard time” cutoff under the new transition rules. 

 For a month prior to the transition this past spring, the separator pages generated by the shared company printers contained a handy reminder that Daylight Saving Time began early this year.
 The reminder remained on the separator pages as late as the summer solstice.
 Maybe the people who design the separator pages didn’t have anything more interesting to say, so they let the old message ride.
