        Recently-unearthed documents reveal that back in the 1950’s,  France proposed merging with United Kingdom into a single country or at least joining the  Commonwealth. Apparently, Churchill proposed a similar alliance in the 1940. It too was rejected. (Other coverage. There’s a secret joke in that article: Check out the URL.)
 Apparently,  the proposal was never seriously considered.
 Ah, what could have been…
