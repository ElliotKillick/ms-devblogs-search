Consider a class with
a bunch of BOOL members:


// no nitpicking over BOOL vs bool allowed
class Pear {
 …
 BOOL m_peeled;
 BOOL m_sliced;
 BOOL m_pitted;
 BOOL m_rotten;
 …
};


You might be tempted to convert the BOOL fields
into bitfields:

class Pear {
 …
 BOOL m_peeled:1;
 BOOL m_sliced:1;
 BOOL m_pitted:1;
 BOOL m_rotten:1;
 …
};


Since a BOOL is typedef’d as INT (which on
Windows platforms is a signed 32-bit integer),
this takes sixteen bytes and packs them into one.
That’s a 93% savings!
Who could complain about that?


How much did that savings cost you, and how much did you save anyway?


Let’s look at the cost of that savings.
Code that updated the plain BOOL
m_sliced member could do it by simply storing the result
into the member.
Since it was a normal field,
this could be accomplished directly:


  mov [ebx+01Ch], eax ; m_sliced = sliced


On the other hand, when it’s a bitfield, updating it becomes trickier:


  add eax, eax        ; shift “sliced” into the correct position
  xor eax, [ebx+01Ch] ; merge “sliced” with other bits
  and eax, 2
  xor [ebx+01Ch], eax ; store the new bitfield


Exercise: Figure out how the above trick works.


Converting a BOOL to a single-bit field saved three bytes
of data but cost you eight bytes of code when the member is assigned
a non-constant value.
Similarly, extracting the value gets more expensive.
What used to be


 push [ebx+01Ch]      ; m_sliced
 call _Something@4    ; Something(m_sliced);


becomes


 mov  ecx, [ebx+01Ch] ; load bitfield value
 shl  ecx, 30         ; put bit at top
 sar  ecx, 31         ; move down and sign extend
 push ecx
 call _Something@4    ; Something(m_sliced);


The bitfield version is bigger by nine bytes.


Let’s sit down and do some arithmetic.
Suppose each of these bitfielded fields is accessed six times
in your code, three times for writing and three times for reading.
The cost in code growth is approximately 100 bytes.
It won’t be exactly 102 bytes because the optimizer may be able
to take advantage of values already in registers for some operations,
and the additional instructions may have hidden costs in terms of
reduced register flexibility.
The actual difference may be more, it may be less, but for a
back-of-the-envelope calculation let’s call it 100.
Meanwhile,
the memory savings was 15 byte per class.
Therefore, the breakeven point is seven.
If your program creates fewer than seven instances of this class,
then the code cost exceeds the data savings: Your memory optimization
was a memory de-optimization.


Even if you manage to come out ahead in the accounting ledger,
it may be a win of just a few hundred bytes.
That’s an awful lot of extra hassle to save a few hundred bytes.
All somebody has to do is add an icon to a dialog box and your
savings will vanish.


When I see people making these sorts of

micro-optimizations,
sometimes I’ll ask them,
“How many instances of this class does the program create?”
and sometimes the response will be,
“Oh, maybe a half dozen. Why do you ask?”


But wait, there’s more.
Packing all these members into a bitfield has other costs.
You lose the ability to set a hardware write breakpoint on a specific bit,
since hardware breakpoints are done at the byte level (at a minimum).
You also lose atomicity:
An update to m_sliced will interfere with a simultaneous
update to m_peeled on another thread,
since the update process merges the two values and stores the result
non-atomically.
(Note that you also lose atomicity if you had used a byte-sized
bool instead of a 32-bit BOOL because some CPU
architectures such as the original Alpha AXP cannot access memory
in units smaller than a DWORD.)


These are just a few things to take into account when considering
whether you should change your fields to bitfields.
Sure, bitfields save data memory, but you have to balance it
against the cost in code size, debuggability, and reduced multithreading.
If your class is going to be instantiated only a few times
(and by “a few” I’m thinking less than a few thousand times),
then these costs most likely exceed the savings.
