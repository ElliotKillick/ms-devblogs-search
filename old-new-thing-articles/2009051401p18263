         The Scotts Valley school system is asking parents to compensate the district  when they take their kids out of school to go on vacation. Adds a new wrinkle to the phrase “pay for play”. 
 I remember the days when we were taught the difference between the things you must do (obligations, responsibilities) and the things you want to do.
