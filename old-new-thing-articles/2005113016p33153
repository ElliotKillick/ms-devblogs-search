An earlier name for
Windows Server 2003 was Microsoft Windows .NET Server,
and in the final weeks leading up the the product’s release,
we received the following bug from a beta tester:


When I call the GetVersionEx function on
build 3773, the OS name is still reported as
“Microsoft Windows .NET Enterprise Server”.
I have attached a sample program illustrating the bug.


I found this kind of confusing, because the GetVersionEx
function doesn’t return a human-readable product name.
Intriguged, I took a look at the sample program and it wasn’t too hard to
see where the bug was.
The program contained the lines


if ( osvi.dwMajorVersion == 5 && osvi.dwMinorVersion == 2 )
   lstrcpyn(szOS, L”Microsoft Windows .NET”, MAX_PATH);


In other words, the program had the incorrect string
hard-coded into it.


I reported my findings back to the person who submitted the bug,
and the response was “Oops, sorry about that.”
