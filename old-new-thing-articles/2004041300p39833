          The principle of “garbage in, garbage out” applies to Unicode collation.  If you hand it a meaningless string and ask to compare it to another  meaningless string, you get meaningless results.  
  I am not a Unicode expert; I just play one on the web.  A real Unicode expert is Michael Kaplan,  whose    explanation of how comparing invalid Unicode strings result  in nonsensical results  I strongly recommend to those who attempt to generate  random test strings in Unicode.
