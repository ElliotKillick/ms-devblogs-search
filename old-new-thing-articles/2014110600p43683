There are various ways of getting a monitor.
You can get the monitor from a point,
from a rectangle,
or from a window.
But how do you get the primary monitor?


The primary monitor is defined to be the one
which has (0, 0) as its origin.
Therefore,

one solution
is


HMONITOR GetPrimaryMonitor()
{
 POINT ptZero = { 0, 0 };
 return MonitorFromPoint(ptZero,
                         MONITOR_DEFAULTTOPRIMARY);
}


The desktop window by convention is deemed to reside
primarily on the primary monitor,
so you could also use this:


HMONITOR GetPrimaryMonitor()
{
 return MonitorFromWindow(GetDesktopWindow(),
                          MONITOR_DEFAULTTOPRIMARY);
}


Or you could just pass the null window handle.
This is technically an illegal parameter,
but by specifying
MONITOR_DEFAULT­TO­PRIMARY,
you are saying,
“If anything goes wrong,
give me the primary monitor.”


HMONITOR GetPrimaryMonitor()
{
 return MonitorFromWindow(nullptr,
                          MONITOR_DEFAULTTOPRIMARY);
}


In this case, we are intentionally going astray
because we want to kick in the
MONITOR_DEFAULT­TO­PRIMARY
behavior.
