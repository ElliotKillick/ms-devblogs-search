        The Innkeeper’s Bed & Breakfast brand of baked goods is sold exclusively at Costco. One of the varieties they offer is an apple-flavored bread which they call Apple Strudel.

If you take a closer look, you’ll see that the packaging actually reads Apple Strüdel. The word Strudel comes from the German word Strudel, which means whirlpool. There is no umlaut in the original German, but that never stopped any marketing department from adding one.
 Previously.
