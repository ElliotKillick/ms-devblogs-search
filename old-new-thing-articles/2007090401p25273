        It’s the season where people with fruit trees in their yard are drowning in fresh fruit, be they pears, apples, plums, whatever. It’s not long before you find yourself desperately looking for people to give it away to, having pretty much run out of things you can make plums into.
 This is where  Community Fruit Tree Harvest steps in. (Coverage in  The Seattle Times and  The Seattle Post-Intelligencer. There’s also  Lettuce Link for donating produce from your home garden.)
 The volunteers at Community Fruit Tree Harvest will visit your house and pick the fruit from your tree, donating it to local food banks. Everybody wins: You don’t have to deal with all the extra fruit, the food banks get fresh fruit, nothing goes to waste. (This is one of those “Why didn’t somebody think of this sooner?” type of programs.) Contact telephone numbers are on the web pages. It appears that they currently cover the Wallingford, Phinney Ridge, and Green Lake neighborhoods.
