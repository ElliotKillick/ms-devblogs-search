        Commenter kinokijuf wonders  whether the Windows 95 interface had a code name.
 Nope.
 We called it “the new shell” while it was under preliminary development, and when it got enabled in the builds, we just called it “the shell.”
 (Explorer originally was named Cabinet, unrelated to  the container file format of the same name. This original name lingers in the window class: CabinetWClass.)
