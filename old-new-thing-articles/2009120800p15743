        On an internal discussion group, somebody decided to quote one of my blog entries.
  Jim Medding was amused by my response:  Bloggers are just idiots with a Web site.
 (My blog was dug up in order to refute a claim, even though the blog entry applied to a situation different from the one under discussion.)
