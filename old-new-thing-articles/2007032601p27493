         Scott Hanselman let me know he was going to be in town, and after some negotiation with the company PR department (who probably get the massive heebie-jeebies from this whole blog thing), I was able to accept his invitation to appear on his weekly podcast,  HanselMinutes.  We sat down for a little chat, and a few weeks later,  I became Show #56.
 I haven’t had the nerve to listen to it myself. I hope I came off okay.
 In other self-promotion news (did I mention yet that  I wrote a book?), it looks like I will be in Palo Alto on April 21 for a family event, and I’ll likely spend the 20th visiting Microsoft’s Silicon Valley Campus. If you’d like me to pay a visit to your user group or whatever, let me know.
