         Welcome to Black Friday, the traditional start of the Christmas shopping season. I suspect there will be a bunch of people who are hoping Santa will get them an  iPhone. Here’s one story of what lies in store. 
  One of my friends  stood in line on the first day of iPhone availability and got one of the highly-anticipated gadgets. We happened to get together two days later, and of course there was a lot of showing off and playing with the phone’s features. But for me what was telling was the part of the phone which shows you the phone usage statistics. After two days, the numbers looked something like this: 

Data downloaded from the Internet: 500MB 
Minutes talking on the phone: 2
