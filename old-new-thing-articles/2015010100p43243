        The Find­Resource­Ex function is an extension of the Find­Resource function in that it allows you to specify a particular language fork in which to search for the resource. Calilng the Find­Resource function is equivalent to calling Find­Resource­Ex and passing zero as the wLanguage. 
Except for the horrible nasty gotcha: The second and third parameters to Find­Resource­Ex are in the opposite order compared to the second and third parameters to Find­Resource! 
In other words, if you are adding custom language support to a program, you cannot just stick a wLanguage parameter on the end when you switch from Find­Resource to Find­Resource­Ex. You also have to flip the second and third parameters. 


Original code
    Find­Resource(hModule,     MAKEINTRESOURCE(IDB_MYBITMAP),     RT_BITMAP) 


You change it to
    Find­Resource­Ex(hModule,     MAKEINTRESOURCE(IDB_MYBITMAP),     RT_BITMAP,     0) 


You should have changed it to
    Find­Resource­Ex(hModule,         RT_BITMAP,         MAKEINTRESOURCE(IDB_MYBITMAP),     0) 


The nasty part of this is that since the second and third parameters are the same type, the compiler won’t notice that you got them backward. The only way you find out is that your resource code suddenly stopped working.
