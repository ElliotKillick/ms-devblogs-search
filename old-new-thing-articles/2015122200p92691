        I ran an internal tool, and it communicated with a back-end service, and then displayed the error 
Unhandled Exception: Cannot print exception string because Exception.ToString() failed. 
I can’t figure out what that even means. 
I waited a little while, then tried again, 
It worked the second time. 
Didn’t even need to turn it off and back on again.
