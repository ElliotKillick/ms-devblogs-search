        Dutch police have arrested 52 people suspected of defrauding gullible Internet users in one of the largest busts of the infamous “Nigerian e-mail” scam. Hooray for the Dutch police. Their next target: Web sites that illustrate a Dutch article with the Danish flag.
(I must sheepishly admit that I too mistakenly identified the home of Ikea as Denmark rather than the Netherlands.)
