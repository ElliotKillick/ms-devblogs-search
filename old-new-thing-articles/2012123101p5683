Another round of the semi-annual link clearance.


Snark



    
    New! Improved! Shape Up Your Life!:
    The New York Times book review of Timothy Ferriss’s
    
    The 4-Hour Body
    reads like a recap on
    
    Television Without Pity,
    but this time they’re making fun of a book!
    “‘The 4-Hour Body’ reads as if The New England Journal
    of Medicine had been hijacked by the editors of the SkyMall catalog.”
    A few months later,
    
    they did a less snarky profile of the man.

    
    There’s nothing more embarrassing than showing up
    for a sleepover with the same pod as everyone else.
    I wasn’t that interested in the article, but that one line
    is a winner.

    Something to prepare you for the summer movie season:
    
    Coming Soon to a Theater Near You (Unfortunately).
    Actually, I think the comments are funnier than the main article.

    I recall that one time while waiting to board my flight, I heard
    the statement “Before we begin primary boarding,
    we’d like to invite X members to board at this time”
    for about
    
    five different values of X.

Tech



    The
    
    Defrag Tools
    show digs into
    
    the early history of the
    MSConfig tool.
    You can see the original bar napkin on which MSConfig was
    designed,
    and learn how I got involved.
    (Answer: Timecode
    5:50.)

    
    StarCraft: Orcs in space go down in flames.
    I love these stories from the trenches.
    Remember, the purpose of these stories is not so you can say,
    “Ha ha, what a bunch of idiots.”
    It’s so that you can say,
    “Gosh, thanks for the warning.”

    
    Learn to Read the Source, Luke.
    One of the overlooked skills of a developer is the ability
    to follow code into a foreign code base.
    The fact that hitting F11 takes you into a file you’ve never
    seen before is no excuse for throwing up your hands and saying,
    “I give up.”

    
    High-Performance JavaScript on Modern Engines
    gives you a peek behind modern JavaScript engines and
    how you can arrange your code so it optimizes well.

    
    Windows 95 Tips, Tricks, and Tweaks
    is brilliantly twisted.

    
    How to take an alias on outlook.com and make it your primary account.
    Here’s a
    
    step-by-step version.

    
    How scammers make money from people who click
    Like on Facebook viral links.

    I love the tradition
    (begun by
    Tony Chor)
    of the Internet Explorer team sending a
    congratulatory cake to the Firefox team for each new release of Firefox.
    It’s also very nice to know that
    
    the Firefox folks return the gesture.

    This arrived too late for me to include it in my
    Microsoft Research quarterly update,
    but it was too awesome to hold for another year.
    
    Speech recognition demonstration.
    At 3:17, you can see the speech recognition system
    doing live transcription.
    I have to admit,
    when the presentation reached its punch line at 7:30,
    I got a little choked up.

    By the way, the Microsoft Research project to develop the time machine
    
    may want to get tips from this guy,
    who has not only
    
    teleported to a secret government Mars colony,
    but also claims that
    
    his traveling companion was Barack Obama.

    Do you know who Russell Kirsch is?
    
    You will soon.
    (Read the
    
    follow-up, too.)

    There’s still time to get your
    
    free Windows Media Center add-on for Windows 8 Pro.


Culture (or what passes for it)



    A while back, I realized that
    
    material goods are a burden.
    Americans in general have yet to figure this out,
    
    and all their stuff makes them unhappy.

    
    Ken Levine‘s
    
    tribute to Shari Lewis.

    
    The Honor System:
    Teller (the less boistrous half of the Penn and Teller
    illusionist team)
    invokes copyright law to protect one of his signature illusions.
    Bonus link:
    
    Teller Reveals His Secrets.

    
    Wally Feresten is
    Saturday Night Live‘s
    cue card guy,
    one of the few remaining in the business.

    
    Helicopter Parents Hover in the Workplace.

    Jerry Seinfeld
    
    explains how he writes a joke,
    using his Pop-Tart joke as a subject.
    This video was created to accompany
    
    a very long article on the comic.

    
    Slate‘s Reader Takeover
    directed staff critic Troy Patterson to
    
    review cheap beers.
    And Bud Light doesn’t even count; it’s not cheap enough.
    Pull quote:
    “Natural Light is among the cheap beers sold by the 30-pack,
    which, based on my own experience as an undergraduate,
    constitutes a single serving.”
    Along the way,
    you actually learn something about the economics of cheap beer.

    
    The making of the Gangnam Style add-on for
    Dance Central 3.
    There appears to be an unwritten rule that people with
    Japanese-sounding names who work on Kinect
    
    must wear sunglasses indoors.
    (I was surprised to learn that
    Kudo is the brother-in-law of one of my childhood
    friends. So my Kudo number is 3, possibly 2.)


Other Stuff



    
    How to spot an amateur.
    As one commenter noted, a common theme is that amateurs
    
    tend to overdo whatever it is they’re doing.

    
    Facilities Management behind the Olympics.
    I’m fascinated by logistics.

    
    Everything Is Different Now:
    Funny and touching.
    (The photo caption won it for me.)
    I wish them the best, even though I don’t even know their names
    or what they look like.

    Another tribute to the wisdom of our elders:
    61-year-old retired potato farmer Cliff Young
    
    wins one of the most grueling endurance races
    by being the tortoise, not the hare.

    
    Marathon Man:
    The mystery of Kip Litton’s marathon runs.

    The GIF Guide to how the U.S. gymnastics team won gold in London.

    Spoiler alert:
    If you’ve never taken
    
    The Marshmallow Challenge,
    then don’t click through.
    It’s much more fun if you don’t see how people solved the problem.
    Here’s
    
    one impressive solution (the page is in Slovak,
    but
    
    the picture doesn’t require translation).
    Here’s
    
    another solution.
    (When I took the challenge, I was part of a team consisting of
    two mathematicians, an accountant, and an economist.
    We won, though our solution was much less impressive.
    I set expectations at the start by saying,
    “Okay, we’re not going to win.
    Let’s try not to lose.”
    We ended up winning because nearly everybody else lost.)

    A former inmate

    Answer: It’s so nice, some prisoners don’t want to leave.

    
    The Lying Disease, also known informally as
    Munchausen by Internet.
    Fascinating and horrifying.

    
    Snow Fall,
    a multimedia arti^H^H^H^Hmini-book on the Tunnel Creek avalanche.

    Stereotypes about what men and women really want in a mate
    
    were confirmed in a speed-dating exercise.

    A less academically-rigorous experiment was conducted by
    Rob Fee:
    He set up a fake profile on OK Cupid with
    a photo of a cute girl,
    accompanied by text that is utterly insane.
    Will guys realize that this girl is a total basket case?
    
    Of course not.
    (Risqué photos at bottom of page may be NSFW.)

    The difference between men and women:
    As part of the divorce, this couple had to divide their
    art collection, and the judge asked each to submit
    how they think the collection
    should be divided. The woman described her emotional reaction
    to each piece or how the scenes related to her life.
    The man said that he needed the artwork to secure
    a line of credit, and
    “I have a lot of wall space to cover.”

    Extremist who advocates harrassing and even killing
    people who disagree with him
    and who mocks legal means of trying to shut him up
    becomes targeted by…
    oh you know where this is going.
    
    Wallow in the Schadenfreude.
    (NSFW for strong language.)

    
    Ira Glass teaches how to make balloon animals
    while answering questions about relationships and sex.
    No, really!
    (Sex questions NSFW.)


And, as always, the obligatory plug for my column in

TechNet Magazine:



    
    Aliens Ate My Software.

    
    Living and Dying by the Demo.
    Long Zheng
    
    fell into this trap
    when he saw a Missed calls tile in a sample and concluded,
    “Windows 8 will have cell phone calling capability.”
    (Except that he used
    
    the question mark escape hatch which lets you start a rumor
    and call it news.)
    I don’t know where he got the idea that these samples
    were from built-in apps. I went back and listened to Kip’s talk again,
    and he says (timecode 12:23),
    “Here’s examples from our template catalog.”
    In other words, they were all fake!
