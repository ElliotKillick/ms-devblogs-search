asks about the mysterious function EnumClaw
that existed in some versions of the Win32 documentation.


I went digging through the MSDN archives and was close to giving up
and declaring the cause lost,
but then I found it: A copy
of the EnumClaw documentation.


EnumClaw


The EnumClaw function returns the child or the parent
of the window whose HWND is passed in.


HWND EnumClaw(
  HWND hwndParent    // handle to parent window
);



Parameters

hwndParent
[in] Handle to the parent window.



Return Values


If the function succeeds, the return value is
the HWND of the child of the hwndParent window.
If the window has no child,
the return value is the HWND of the parent of the hwndParent window.


If the function fails, the return value is NULL.
To get extended error information, call

GetLastError.



Requirements

  Windows NT/2000/XP:
    Included in Windows XP and Windows .NET Server.
  Windows 95/98/Me: Unsupported.
  Header: Declared in Winuser.h; include Windows.h.
  Library: Use User32.lib.

There was never a function called EnumClaw.
This was a joke inserted by the documentation folks,
a pun on the Washington city named

Enumclaw.
(The state of Washington has a lot of place names which come
from Native American words.
Other examples are

Sequim,

Puyallup,
and

Tulalip.
At least Enumclaw is pronounced almost like it’s spelled.)
