          The BBC reports that    official documents in Taiwan must now be written left-to-right  (Western style) instead of the traditional top-to-bottom.  
  I grew up with Chinese-language newspapers that ran their stories  vertically and numbered their pages from right to left,  in the traditional manner.  Books and newspapers which run left-to-right look “wrong” to me.  But I guess I’ll have to start getting used to it.
