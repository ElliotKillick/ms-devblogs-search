Window subclassing is trickier than you think.
Consider this code sketch:


// Subclass the window for a little while
WNDPROC OldWndProc = SubclassWindow(hwnd, NewWndProc);
... do stuff ...
// Okay all done, remove our subclass by
// restoring the previous window procedure
SubclassWindow(hwnd, OldWndProc);

What could go wrong?

Weâ€™ll discuss it tomorrow.
