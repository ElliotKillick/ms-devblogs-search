         I dreamed that I was asked to develop a hill-avoiding bike route from my childhood home. Along the way, I rode through a daycare playroom (twice, due to a spiral path), met Madonna, the ghost of Alec Baldwin’s wife, a team from The Amazing Race trying to figure out which PATH train goes to Grand Central (trick question!) and waited for the next train with a supervillain who demonstrated his powers by using his stretchy arms to punch one of my colleagues who was standing ten feet away and who electrocuted another colleague’s pacemaker by force of will. 
 Yes, I know that Alec Baldwin is not a widower, and my colleague does not have a pacemaker, but I guess my subconscious doesn’t care.
