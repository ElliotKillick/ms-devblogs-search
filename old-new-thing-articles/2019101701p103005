        The science fiction parody Galaxy Quest was a moderate success at the box office when it was released twenty years ago. It subsequently gained a following, particularly among the Star Trek fan community, even earning a place in the voting for “Best Star Trek movie”. (It  came in seventh.)
“Galaxy Quest is the best Star Trek movie.” — Wil Wheaton
“Why didn’t we do this?” — Brent Spiner
“Brilliant. No one laughed louder or longer in the cinema than I did.” — Patrick Stewart
“For the life of me I was trying to understand who he [Tim Allen] was imitating.” — William Shatner
(Man, I sure hope Shatner had his tongue firmly planted in his cheek.)
And now there’s Never Surrender: A Galaxy Quest Documentary.

Screening at selected theaters in the United States,  for one night only: November 26, 2019. The screening includes deleted scenes and a Galaxy Quest trailer by Honest Trailers.
Bonus chatter: The Longhorn project (which eventually became Windows Vista) famously underwent a  development reset. The work to reset the engineering system was code named Omega 13, after the time travel device in Galaxy Quest.
