        The FILE_BASIC_INFO structure contains a number of fields which record the last time a particular action occurred. Two of the fields seem to describe the same thing.


Last­Write­Time  

The time the file was last written to.

Change­Time  


The time the file was changed.







 What’s the difference between writing to a file and changing it?
 I’m told that the difference is metadata. The Last­Write­Time covers writes to the file’s data stream (which you accomplish via the Write­File function). On the other hand, the Change­Time also includes changes to the file metadata, such as changing its file attributes (hidden, read-only, etc.) or renaming the file.
 (And don’t forget that  Last­Access­Time updates are off by default now.)
