         Time for the semi-annual link clearance. 

     It appears that the          Snipping Tool     is          also available for Windows XP. 
     How to beat the no-fly list:          Change your name. 
     How to beat the low printer ink sensor:          electrical tape. 
     Learn about          Milliways,     the unfinished sequel to the adventure game          The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.     It’s a fascinating insight into how these sorts of games are built. 
     Saw a link to this program, looks useful, haven’t tried it though.          Mp3 Knife is a simple tool which extracts clips from mp3 files. 
     I don’t have a Bluetooth-enabled laptop yet, but someday I may,     and then          I’ll give the bitpim program a whirl. 
     One of the most awesome music videos from the 1980’s     gets even more awesome:          Take On Me: The Literal Lyrics Version.     (My favorite throwaway line: “What kind of hallway is this?”)          MSNBC interviews     the creator. 
     The          guys behind the Mentos and Diet Coke fountain video     strike again:          Having fun with Post-It notes. 
          An Engineer’s Guide to Cats:     “Like most engineers,     cats are pretty much willing to eat the same thing     day after day after day.” 
          Preview PDF files directly from Outlook. 
     Timewasting game:          Fantastic Contraption. 
     Timewasting game #2:          Light Bot. 
          Not Fooling Anybody. 
          The curse of competence. 
     Dilbert invented          the carbicle.     Back in the early 1990’s, a bunch of us invented something     similar to the carbicle at the lunch table.     Though our version was a lot lamer because these were the days before     wireless networking, mobile phones, LCD monitors, and     notebook computers you would actually be caught dead with. 
          SafeCatch thwarts two potential bank robberies     a few months ago.     (Earlier coverage.) 
     The travel site Yapta     will alert you when frequent-flyer seats become available     on flights you care about,     giving you a better chance to          spend those miles before they expire. 
          Digitally Assisted Billiards     [via].     But even with this, I’d probably still lose. 
     Another glimpse into a mystery world:             the tunnels beneath Las Vegas. 
     Another glimpse into a mystery world:          The people who hate cilantro. 
          Earl Pomerantz does it again with his simple storytelling:     Too Big For My Bathing Suit          Part 1     and          Part 2. 
          Exploiting Multi-Core Processors in Windows Vista,     a quick overview. 
     In my PDC 2008 round-up, I forgot to mention          Rick Hallihan‘s     musings on crowd management,     the worst-fit algorithm, and some          panoramas of the Big Room.     The scary thing is, those panoramas don’t even cover all     of the Big Room… 

 Finally, we have the traditional plug for my column in  TechNet Magazine: 

          History taking up space.     The original title for this article was          What about Bob?     Bonus trivia:     The code name Utopia was actually an acronym.     It stood for (I am not making this up)     Unified, Task-Oriented, Personality-Infected, Active. 
          The dying breath of the Alpha AXP was not breathed in vain:     The archivist who rolled the computer out of its dusty closet     for the photo shoot quipped,     “I’m considering filing a workmans comp claim now.     That thing has terrible handling and zero drivability!”     If you look at the picture, you can see a layer of dust.     We left it there just for old time’s sake.     And here are some supplementary links for the article.     

          Compaq drops support for Windows on the Alpha AXP.     
          64-bit Windows was initially developed on the Alpha AXP     (last paragraph).     
          Willy Denoyette reminisces on 64-bit Windows for the Alpha AXP.     
          The blog entry in which I retired the machine featured in the article.     


          Windows 95 Unplugged. 
          Work Harder, Not Smarter. 
          Windows Can but Won’t.     Replacing a file in use is the easy part.     Getting it to work is the hard part. 
          Keep Your Caches Close.     The original title was          Keep your data close and your caches closer,     but that had to be trimmed for space.
