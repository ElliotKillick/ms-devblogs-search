        There were flyers in our building inviting people to attend a food event called A Taste of WWL.
 The letters WWL stand for Windows and Windows Live, but the font they chose for the sign was confusing to me. The capital L looked like a capital I, and I misread the poster as an invitation to attend A Taste of WWI. 
 And then I thought, “Who the heck thought World War I was a fun event we’d want to re-experience?” 
 One of my colleagues, who also misread the poster, had a much more succinct response: “Mmmm… mustard gas…”
