         Hans Bjordahl’s  Bug Bash is one of those it’s funny because it’s true comics about life inside a software company. Specifically,  Microsoft, where Hans worked for many years and whose internal newsletter featured  Hans’s strip. (Some might argue that Bug Bash was the only part of the company newsletter worth reading.) 
 Today I’m going to share two of my favorites. 

          Internal marketing campaigns.     The year 2004 was a particularly     good one     (or in     the opinion of     some people:     a particularly bad one)     for internal     marketing campaigns at Microsoft,     with about forty pieces of internal marketing delivered to     your maildrop during the year.     That’s a piece of internal junk mail nearly every week!     Perhaps in response, the year 2005 was unusually sparse.     But internal marketing appears to be on the rise again,     though fortunately not yet to the heights of 2004. 
          Blog all you want.     The subtitle on the fake newspaper headline wins it. 

 Bonus discovery, Hans  revealed himself as the co-founder of  Mr. Cranky. Man, I loved that site.
