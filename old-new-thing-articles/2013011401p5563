         I  did it briefly a few years ago, but I’m going to make it a regular Monday feature, at least for this year: Blogging my dreams. 
 I dreamed that I was back in my high school English class, and due to some new state law, everybody was required to watch this video of a singing hippo. The hard part was walking four miles to the nearest viewing location, seeing as we didn’t even have a TCP/IP standard yet, much less YouTube. 
 To think that this is the culmination of the technological advances of the last three decades: Being able to watch a singing hippo on demand.
