Am I the only one who find these icons bizarro?



The catcow



The dogoldfish




The first time I saw them, I thought the first one was a cow and the
second one was a goldfish. But apparently they’re a cat and a dog.


I never understood the need for these emoticons in the first place.
If you need to add a smiley face to indicate that you’re joking,
then you need to work on your delivery.
