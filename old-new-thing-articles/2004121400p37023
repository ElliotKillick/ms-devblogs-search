         It’s easy to distribute points evenly across a flat surface, but doing so over a curved surface is a much more complicated problem.  Even spheres are hard.

. You can also download the paper (in PDF form) from Dr. Saff’s home page, if you think you’re smart enough to understand it. (Don’t ask me for help. I have two degrees in mathematics and was in over my head by halfway through page 2. I couldn’t even make it out of the Introduction.)
