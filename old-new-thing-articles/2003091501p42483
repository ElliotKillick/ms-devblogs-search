        Eric Lippert has posted Eric’s
        Complete Guide to BSTR Semantics. This is a document that is widely valued within
        Microsoft, since BSTR semantics are rather tricky, and I’m glad he’s willing to share
        it with the world.
    

        In particular, Eric spends quite a bit of time discussion the very important equivalence
        of NULL and L”” in BSTR semantics, something that is buried
        in paragraph seven of an MSDN document you probably didn’t even bother reading.
    
    If you ask nicely, you might be able to convince him to post his “Complete history
    of OLEDATE”.
