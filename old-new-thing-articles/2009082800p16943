        The naming convention for HRESULT is «facility»_«severity»_«name», where the facility portion (and the underscore) is omitted if the facility is FACILITY_NULL or FACILITY_WIN32.
 Good luck finding anybody who follows this naming convention.
 Okay, fine, if you look closely you might be able to find some people who do.

 Actually, I guess I was a bit too pessimistic when I said nobody follows it. It seems that the majority of Windows components do follow this convention, although there are some notable exceptions.

DDERR_UNSUPPORTEDFORMAT


ADSI  
E_ADS_INVALID_DOMAIN_OBJECT


 There are also some people who decided to confuse matters further by using the HRESULT convention for error codes returned by GetLastError()!


RPC  
RPC_S_OBJECT_NOT_FOUND


SmartCard  
SEC_E_SMARTCARD_CERT_REVOKED
