        In the Windows division, we have a number of internal tools. One of them is for assigning test failures.
I needed to assign a test failure to another team. I entered the team’s email alias into the tool, but the tool rejected it. The team’s email alias was 21 characters long, but the tool’s limit is only 20 characters. (This is a very old tool, and my guess is that at the time the tool was written, email aliases were only 8 characters long. “Twenty characters should be enough for anyone.”)
That’s a sneaky way to make sure nobody assigns test failures to your team.
