         WindowsÂ 8 added a new hotkey: Win+PrtSc takes a snapshot of your screen and puts it into the Screenshots folder of your Pictures library. But what if you are on a tablet with no PrtSc key? 
 On tablets, you can perform the same operation by pressing Windows button + Volume down. Both of these are the hardware buttons on the tablet, not on any keyboard.
