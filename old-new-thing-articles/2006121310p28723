        In a classic series, Electronic Games Monthly plopped modern kids, ages 9 through 12, in front of classic video games: Pong, Donkey Kong, Tetris.  And then recorded their reactions. Here, the kids are playing Tetris and appear to be obsessed with stuff blowing up.
  Tim: Which button do I press to make the blocks explode? 
 EGM: Sorry, they don’t explode. 
 Becky: This is boring. Maybe if it had characters and stuff and different levels, it would be OK. If things blew up or something or— 
 Sheldon: If there were bombs. 
 Becky: Yeah, or special bricks. Like, if a yellow brick touched a red brick it would blow up and you’d have to start over. 
 John: Why haven’t I won yet? I’ve paired up so many of the same color. 
 EGM: Don’t worry about colors. 
 John: I just lined up six of the same color. Why didn’t they blow up? 
 EGM: Nothing blows up. 

 Best single line: “I’m sure everyone who made this game is dead by now.”
 The article was such a hit that they  did it again the following year.
