         If you want to know still more about C# anonymous methods, you can check out the web site of  Grant Richins who has  an entire category devoted to anonymous methods, and he should know, since  he actually implemented them. 
 Now that CLR week is over, I’m curious what you all thought of it. Would you like to see another CLR week at some point? Should I stick to Win32? (Or doesn’t it matter because I’m an arrogant Microsoft apologist either way?)
