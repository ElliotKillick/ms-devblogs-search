        Meetings are so passé. You no longer have a meeting with a customer; you have an engagement:
 I have a customer engagement tomorrow and they have a question surrounding Feature X. 
 Note that this use of the phrase customer engagement is different from the process known as customer engagement. The process is an ongoing interaction, a long-term activity to build customer loyalty.
 The author of the above sentence is not using it in the process sense (because you don’t have “a” customer engagement; rather, a meeting is one component of the overall process of customer engagement). Nope, the author is just trying to sound cool.
