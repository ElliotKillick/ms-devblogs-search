          The White House is doing some renovating of its own (NYT, free registration required), in order to refurbish a section of the lawn that is used by television reporters so they can stand there with a nice picture of the White House behind them.
 But that’s not why I found this story interesting.
 Go about halfway down the article: “The light and heat from the television lights, sometimes 14 hours a day, were confusing the trees”, causing them to sprout leaves in winter and flower out of season.
 Even the trees are falling for the media’s lies.
