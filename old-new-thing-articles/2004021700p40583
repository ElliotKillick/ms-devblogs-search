         Somebody@somewhere.else described me as having the social skills of a thermonuclear device. I don’t remember the incident in question, but I’ll have to accept that it happened.
 I have a very low tolerance for laziness. If you come to me for help, I expect you to have done your homework. (Though I try to scale my expectations to your position. If you’re in a coding position then you had better know how to use a debugger. If you’re in a testing position, then you had better know at least how to install the debugger. This is considered part of the standard skill set for a tester.)
 But the absolute worst thing you can do is start a conversation by saying, “Hey, Raymond, since you know everything, can you do this for me…?”
