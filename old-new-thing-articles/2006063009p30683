         A few random links that I’ve collected. 

liveplasma,     graphically depicts links among musicians and movies.     I don’t actually listen to popular music much,     but it’s still fun to play with. 
Slashbuster.          Eats trees for breakfast [WMV].     Other videos. 
Der          Baggertransport 2001 aka     Bagger 288.     Eats medium-sized towns for breakfast. 
     Mandarin Chinese lesson podcast.     Perhaps someday^H^H^Hyear I may be able to use this. 
     Warrington Cycling Campaign’s Cycle Facility of the Month.     It’s hard to pick a favorite, they’re all so great,     but maybe it’s          July 2004. 
     Floor ate hazardous Ohio eels. 
Jesper Holmberg‘s     web log on localization.     For example, you can find discussion of          localizing keyboard shortcuts     (a subject which was of          passing interest some time ago). 
     Public Radio Slave,     answering the telephone at a public radio station. 
     Waiterrant, the online journal of a waiter at what     appears to be a rather fancy restaurant. 
     Logos free books,     online books (mostly children’s stories)     in various languages, often including audio.     But the audio has annoying music in the background, alas. 
The Easter Bunny Hates You (WMV).          Google video version. 
     Dave Barry appeared on local radio station KUOW.     The interview is quite funny. 
     Dancing humans forming a variety of images when viewed from above.     (via Metafilter.)     I’m not sure which I like best; it’s either the running man     or the flapping bird. 
1000 Arte ein Bier zu     öffnen: Ohne Flaschenöffner im Grossstadtdschungel     überleben = “1000 ways to open a beer:     Surviving in the urban jungle without a bottle opener.”     (via     BoingBoing.)     My favorites:          Electric toothbrush (for unexpectedness),          notebook hard drive (for disproportionate expense), and          excavator (for inconvenience). 
How     to eat sushi. 
The Flogsta scream,     a nightly tradition at the     Flogsta dormitories     at     Uppsala University.     (På svenska.) 
A brief and incomplete history of FAT32.     They cut off my punch line, though.     After reading the article, highlight this box with your mouse     (or use Select All if you are keyboard-based)     to see the original final sentence:          At least they didn’t call it “LardButt”. 
Seeing     the world in three dimension for the first time.     Any story that involves Oliver Sacks is bound to be fascinating.
