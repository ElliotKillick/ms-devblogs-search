         We saw earlier that  the caret is the escape character for the batch language. In a comment to that article,  KJK::Hyperion mentioned that the caret  serves as the line continuation character. A useful tip if you still find yourself messing with batch files.  Mark Yocum elaborates on this point a bit more.
