        Many years ago, there was a division-wide meeting for all of the Windows product team. A local convention center was rented out for the occasion, buses were hired to shuttle employees to and from the venue, the usual “very large meeting” nonsense. 
The meeting happened to be scheduled for April 15, which is the day that individual income taxes are due in the United States. 
The organizers of the meeting recognized this, and when employees entered the lobby to check in for the meeting, the organizers provided copies of Form 4868: Application for Automatic Extension of Time To File U.S. Individual Income Tax Return to anyone who wanted one, as well pre-addressed envelopes for mailing it in. 
It was a cute joke, but I saw people taking advantage of it, so maybe it was for practical purposes after all.
