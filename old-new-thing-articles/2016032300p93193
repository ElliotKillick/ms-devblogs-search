        Sometimes the information you receive regarding the location of a document or other resource is not perfectly correct. 
I put the script on \\scratch\temp\bob\widgetstuff\enable­widgets.cmd. 
But then you look, and oh no it’s not there! 
Don’t give up yet. 
Look around you. 
Maybe the script is in a nearby directory. Maybe Bob misspelled the path or file name. 
Got it, thanks. It was actually in a scripts subdirectory, but I was extra smart and figured that out for myself! I deserve a cookie. 
I have been known to give information that is intentionally ever-so-slightly incorrect in an obvious way (like misspelling a function name or providing the wrong number of parameters), so that the person receiving the information will be forced to look around.
