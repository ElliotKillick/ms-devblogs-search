         Some time ago, I  noted the increasing luxurification of camping, where people with more money than sense decide to go through the camping experience without building any of the character that comes with it. 
 But that’s not the only direction luxurification has moved. Unwilling to accept that “getting there is half the fun”, some people  take chartered planes to and from summer camp. Stick it out for the punch line in the final sentence of the article.
