        “The marijuana is grown in the middle of some very respectable Seattle suburbs, such as Renton.”
 This is a funny sentence if you’re a longtime resident of the greater Seattle area, because Renton has historically been a working-class town. (Here’s Almost Live‘s  parody of South King County to give you an idea of what Renton is up against.)
 The city is  working to change its reputation. I wish them luck.
