The

Get­Environment­Strings function
has a long and troubled history.


The first bit of confusion is that the day it was introduced
in Windows NT 3.1, it was exported funny.
The UNICODE version was exported under the name
Get­Environment­StringsW,
but the ANSI version was exported under the name
Get­Environment­Strings
without the usual A suffix.


A mistake we have been living with for over two decades.


This is why the winbase.h header file
contains these confusing lines:


WINBASEAPI
LPCH
WINAPI
GetEnvironmentStrings(
    VOID
    );
WINBASEAPI
LPWCH
WINAPI
GetEnvironmentStringsW(
    VOID
    );
#ifdef UNICODE
#define GetEnvironmentStrings  GetEnvironmentStringsW
#else
#define GetEnvironmentStringsA  GetEnvironmentStrings
#endif // !UNICODE


It’s trying to clean up a mess that was created long ago,
and it only partly succeeds.
This is why your IDE may get confused when you try to call
the
Get­Environment­Strings function
and send you to the wrong definition.
It’s having trouble untangling the macros whose job is to
try to untangle the original mistake.


The kernel folks tried to clean this up as quickly as they could,
by exporting new functions with the names
Get­Environment­StringsW and
Get­Environment­StringsA,
like they should have been in the first place,
but for compatibility purposes, they still have to export the weird
unsuffixed
Get­Environment­Strings function.
And then to avoid all the “gotcha!”s from people
looking for proof of nefarious intent,
they kept the mistake in the public header files
to make their actions visible to all.


Though personally, I would have tidied things up differently:


WINBASEAPI
LPCH
WINAPI
GetEnvironmentStrings(
    VOID
    );
WINBASEAPI
LPCH
WINAPI
GetEnvironmentStringsA(
    VOID
    );
WINBASEAPI
LPWCH
WINAPI
GetEnvironmentStringsW(
    VOID
    );
#ifdef UNICODE
#define GetEnvironmentStrings  GetEnvironmentStringsW
#else
#define GetEnvironmentStrings  GetEnvironmentStringsA
#endif // !UNICODE


I would have left the declaration of the mistaken
Get­Environment­Strings function
in the header file, but redirected the symbolic name
to the preferred suffixed version.


But then again, maybe my version would have confused IDEs
even more than the current mechanism does.


The other unfortunate note in the history of the
Get­Environment­Strings function
is the odd way it handled the Unicode environment.
Back in the old days,
the Get­Environment­Strings function

returned a raw pointer to the environment block.
The result was that if some other code modified the environment,
your pointer became invalid,
and there was nothing you could do about it.
As I noted, the function was subsequently changed so that
both the ANSI and Unicode versions return snapshots
of the environment strings,
so that the environment strings you received wouldn’t get
spontaneously corrupted by another thread.
