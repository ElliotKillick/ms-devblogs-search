 Your blog is blocked as “adult content” in the internet cafe I’m currently using in Adelaide, South Australia. Other MSDN blogs show up without problem. 
 You must have really have spiffed up the content since I left the states! 

 Perhaps that should be my new subtitle. “The Old New Thing: Must be 18 or older to enter.”
