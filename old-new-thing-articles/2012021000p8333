Every so often, somebody “discovers” an alleged
security vulnerability in the Format­Message function.
You can try it yourself:


#include <windows.h>
#include <stdio.h>
char buf[2048];
char extralong[128*1024];
int __cdecl main(int argc, char **argv)
{
 memset(extralong, 'x', 128 * 1024 - 1);
 DWORD_PTR args[] = { (DWORD_PTR)extralong };
 FormatMessage(FORMAT_MESSAGE_FROM_STRING |
               FORMAT_MESSAGE_ARGUMENT_ARRAY, "%1", 0, 0,
               buf, 2048, (va_list*)args);
 return 0;
}


If you run this program under the debugger and you tell it to break
on all exceptions,
then you will find that it breaks on an access violation
trying to write to an invalid address.

Did you just find a buffer overflow security vulnerability?


The FormatMessage function was part of the original
Win32 interface,
back in the days when you had lots of address space
(two whole gigabytes) but not a lot of RAM (12 megabytes,
or 16 if you were running Server).
The implementation of FormatMessage reflects
this historical reality by

working hard to conserve RAM
but not worrying too much about conserving address space.
And it takes advantage of this fancy new structured
exception handling feature.


The FormatMessage uses the
reserve a bunch of address space but commit pages only as they
are necessary pattern, illustrated in MSDN
under the topic

Reserving and Committing Memory.
Except that the sample code on that page contains serious errors.
For example, if the sample code encounters an exception other than
STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION, it still “handles”
it by doing nothing and returning
EXCEPTION_EXECUTE_HANDLER.
It fails to handle random access to the buffer
or access violations caused by DEP.
Though in the very specific sample, it mostly works since the
protected region does only one thing, so there aren’t many
opportunities for the other types of exceptions to occur.
(Though if you’re really unlucky, you might get an
STATUS_IN_PAGE_ERROR.)
But enough complaining about that sample.


The FormatMessage
function reserves
64KB
of address space, commits the first page,
and then calls an internal helper function whose job it is
to generate the output,
passing the start of the 64KB block of address space as the
starting address and telling it to give up when it reaches 64KB.
Something like this:


struct DEMANDBUFFER
{
  void *Base;
  SIZE_T Length;
};
int
PageFaultExceptionFilter(DEMANDBUFFER *Buffer,
                         EXCEPTION_RECORD ExceptionRecord)
{
  int Result;
  DWORD dwLastError = GetLastError();
  // The only exception we handle is a continuable read/write
  // access violation inside our demand-commit buffer.
  if (ExceptionRecord->ExceptionFlags & EXCEPTION_NONCONTINUABLE)
    Result = EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_SEARCH;
  else if (ExceptionRecord->ExceptionCode != EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION)
    Result = EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_SEARCH;
  else if (ExceptionRecord->NumberParameters < 2)
    Result = EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_SEARCH;
  else if (ExceptionRecord->ExceptionInformation[0] &
      ~(EXCEPTION_READ_FAULT | EXCEPTION_WRITE_FAULT))
    Result = EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_SEARCH;
  else if (ExceptionRecord->ExceptionInformation[1] -
      (ULONG_PTR)Buffer->Base >= Buffer->Length)
    Result = EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_SEARCH;
  else {
    // If the memory is already committed, then committing memory won't help!
    // (The problem is something like writing to a read-only page.)
    void *ExceptionAddress = (void*)ExceptionInformation[1];
    MEMORY_BASIC_INFORMATION Information;
    if (VirtualQuery(ExceptionAddress, &Information,
                     sizeof(Information)) != sizeof(Information))
      Result = EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_SEARCH;
    else if (Information.State != MEM_RESERVE)
      Result = EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_SEARCH;
    // Okay, handle the exception by committing the page.
    // Exercise: What happens if the faulting memory access
    // spans two pages?
    else if (!VirtualAlloc(ExceptionAddress, 1, MEM_COMMIT, PAGE_READWRITE))
      Result = EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_SEARCH;
    // We successfully committed the memory - retry the operation
    else Result = EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_EXECUTION;
  }
  RestoreLastError(dwLastError);
  return Result;
}
DWORD FormatMessage(...)
{
  DWORD Result = 0;
  DWORD Error;
  DEMANDBUFFER Buffer;
  Error = InitializeDemandBuffer(&Buffer, FORMATMESSAGE_MAXIMUM_OUTPUT);
  if (Error == ERROR_SUCCESS) {
    __try {
     Error = FormatMessageIntoBuffer(&Result,
                                     Buffer.Base, Buffer.Length, ...);
    } __except (PageFaultExceptionFilter(&Buffer,
                   GetExceptionInformation()->ExceptionRecord)) {
     // never reached - we never handle the exception
    }
  }
  if (Error == ERROR_SUCCESS) {
   Error = CopyResultsOutOfBuffer(...);
  }
  DeleteDemandBuffer(&Buffer);
  if (Result == 0) {
    SetLastError(Error);
  }
  return Result;
}


The FormatMessageIntoBuffer function takes an output
buffer and a buffer size, and it writes the result to the output buffer,
stopping when the buffer is full.
The DEMANDBUFFER structure and the
PageFaultExceptionHandler
work together to create the output buffer on demand
as the FormatMessageIntoBuffer function does its work.


To make discussion easier, let’s say that the
FormatMessage function merely took printf-style arguments
and supported only
FORMAT_MESSAGE_FROM_STRING | FORMAT_MESSAGE_ALLOCATE_BUFFER.


DWORD FormatMessageFromStringPrintfAllocateBuffer(
    PWSTR *ResultBuffer,
    PCWSTR FormatString,
    ...)
{
  DWORD Result = 0;
  DWORD ResultString = NULL;
  DWORD Error;
  DEMANDBUFFER Buffer;
  va_list ap;
  va_start(ap, FormatString);
  Error = InitializeDemandBuffer(&Buffer, FORMATMESSAGE_MAXIMUM_OUTPUT);
  if (Error == ERROR_SUCCESS) {
    __try {
     SIZE_T MaxChars = Buffer.Length / sizeof(WCHAR);
     int i = _vsnwprintf((WCHAR*)Buffer.Base, MaxChars,
                         FormatString, ap);
     if (i < 0 || i >= MaxChars) Error = ERROR_MORE_DATA;
     else Result = i;
    } __except (PageFaultExceptionFilter(&Buffer,
                   GetExceptionInformation()->ExceptionRecord)) {
     // never reached - we never handle the exception
    }
  }
  if (Error == ERROR_SUCCESS) {
   // Exercise: Why don't we need to worry about integer overflow?
   DWORD BytesNeeded = sizeof(WCHAR) * (Result + 1);
   ResultString = (PWSTR)LocalAlloc(LMEM_FIXED, BytesNeeded);
   if (ResultBuffer) {
    // Exercise: Why CopyMemory and not StringCchCopy?
    CopyMemory(ResultString, Buffer.Base, BytesNeeded);
   } else Error = ERROR_NOT_ENOUGH_MEMORY;
  }
  DeleteDemandBuffer(&Buffer);
  if (Result == 0) {
    SetLastError(Error);
  }
  *ResultBuffer = ResultString;
  va_end(ap);
  return Result;
}


Let’s run this function in our head to see what happens if
somebody triggers the alleged buffer overflow by calling


PWSTR ResultString;
DWORD Result = FormatMessageFromStringPrintfAllocateBuffer(
                   &ResultString, L"%s", VeryLongString);


After setting up the demand buffer, we call
_vsnwprintf
to format the output into the demand buffer,
but telling it not to go past the buffer’s total length.
The _vsnwprintf function parses the format
string and sees that it needs to copy VeryLongString
to the output buffer.
Let’s say that the DEMANDBUFFER was allocated at
address 0x00780000 on a system with 4KB pages.
At the start of the copy, the address space looks like this:



64KB



00780000C
00781000R
00782000R
00783000R
00784000R
00785000R
00786000R
00787000R
00788000R
00789000R
0078A000R
0078B000R
0078C000R
0078D000R
0078E000R
0078F000R
00790000X


^ output pointer



“C” stands for a committed page, “R” stands for a reserved page,
and “X” stands for a page that, if accessed, would be a buffer overflow.
We start copying VeryLongString into the output buffer.
After copying 2048 characters, we fill the first committed page;
copying character 2049 raises a page fault exception.



64KB



00780000C
00781000R
00782000R
00783000R

0078D000R

0078F000R
00790000X

This is the point at which over-eager people observe the first-chance
exception, capture the register dump above,
and begin writing up their security vulnerability report,
cackling with glee.
(Observe that in the register dump,
the address we are writing to is of the form 0x####1000.)


As with all first-chance exceptions,
it goes down the exception chain.
Our custom PageFaultExceptionFilter recognizes this
as an access violation in a page that it is responsible for,
and the page hasn’t yet been committed, so it commits the page as
read/write and resumes execution.



64KB



00780000C
00781000C
00782000R
00783000R
00784000R
00785000R
00786000R
00787000R
00788000R
00789000R
0078A000R
0078B000R
0078C000R
0078D000R
0078E000R
0078F000R
00790000X



^ output pointer



Copying character 2049 now succeeds, as does the copying of characters
2050 through 4096.
When we hit character 4097, the cycle repeats:



64KB



00780000C
00781000C
00782000R
00783000R
00784000R
00785000R
00786000R
00787000R
00788000R
00789000R
0078A000R
0078B000R
0078C000R
0078D000R
0078E000R
0078F000R
00790000X



^ output pointer



Again, the first-chance exception is sent down the chain,
our
PageFaultExceptionFilter
recognizes this as a page it is responsible for,
and it commits the page and resumes execution.



64KB



00780000C
00781000C
00782000C
00783000R
00784000R
00785000R
00786000R
00787000R
00788000R
00789000R
0078A000R
0078B000R
0078C000R
0078D000R
0078E000R
0078F000R
00790000X



^ output pointer



If you think about it, this is exactly what the memory manager does
with memory that has been allocated but not yet accessed:
The memory is not present,
and the moment an application tries to access it,
the not-present page fault is raised,
the memory manager commits the page,
and then execution resumes normally.
It’s memory-on-demand, which is one of the essential elements of
virtual memory.
What’s going on with the DEMANDBUFFER is that we are
simulating in user mode what the memory manager does in kernel mode.
(The difference is that while the memory manager takes committed
memory and makes it present on demand,
the DEMANDBUFFER takes reserved address space
and commits it on demand.)


The cycle repeats 13 more times, and then we reach another interesting
part of the scenario:



64KB



00780000C
00781000C
00782000C
00783000C
00784000C

00786000C
00787000C
00788000C
00789000C
0078A000C
0078B000C
0078C000C
0078D000C
0078E000C
0078F000C
00790000X


output pointer ^



We are about to write 32768th character into the
DEMANDBUFFER.
Once that’s done, the buffer will be completely full.
One more byte and we will overflow the buffer.
(Not even a wafer-thin byte will fit.)


Let’s write that last character and

cover our ears in anticipation.



64KB

00782000C

^



Oh noes!
Completely full!
Run for cover!


But wait.
We passed a buffer size to the
_vsnwprintf function, remember?
We already told it never to write more than 32768 characters.
As it’s about to write character 32769, it realizes,
“Wait a second, this would overflow the buffer I was given.
I’ll return a failure code instead.”


The feared write of the 32769th character never takes place.
We never write to the “X” page.
Instead, the _vnswprintf call returns that the
buffer was not large enough, which is converted into
ERROR_MORE_DATA and returned to the caller.


If you follow through the entire story, you see that everything
worked as it was supposed to and no overflow took place.
The _vnswprintf function ran up to the brink of
disaster but stopped before taking that last step.
This is hardly anything surprising; it happens whenever
the _vnswprintf function encounters a buffer
too small to hold the output.
The only difference is that along the way, we saw a few
first-chance exceptions,
exceptions that had nothing to do with avoiding the buffer
overflow in the first place.
They were just part of FormatMessage‘s
fancy buffer management.


It so happens that in Windows Vista,
the fancy buffer management technique was abandoned, and
the code just allocates 64KB of memory up front and doesn’t
try any fancy commit-on-demand games.
Computer memory has become plentiful enough that a momentary allocation
of 64KB has less of an impact than it did twenty years ago,
and performance measurements showed that the new
“Stop trying to be so clever” technique was now about 80 times
faster than the “gotta scrimp and save every last byte of memory”
technique.


The change had more than just a performance effect.
It also removed the first-chance exception from FormatMessage,
which means that it no longer does that thing which everybody
mistakes for a security vulnerability.
The good news is that nobody reports this as a vulnerability
in Windows Vista any more.
The bad news is that people still report it as a vulnerability
in Windows XP,
and each
time this issue comes up,
somebody (possibly me) has to sit down and

reverify that the previous analysis is still correct,
in the specific scenario being reported,
because who knows, maybe this time they really did find a problem.
