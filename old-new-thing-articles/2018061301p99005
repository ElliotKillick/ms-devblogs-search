        I submit for your consideration One A Day Teen for Her VitaCraves Gummies. According to the product packaging, the serving size is “2 daily.” 
Indeed, of all the One A Day vitamins listed on that page, none of them has a serving size of one. 
“One a day, for large values of one.”¹ 
¹ Or small values of day.
