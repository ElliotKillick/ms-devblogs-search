        I’ll be at the Build conference next week. Here’s my schedule so far: 

Monday

Attending Dona Sarkar (and some other guy)’s talk                 with the great title slide         at 4:00pm.
After that, I’ll be at the Sets booth at the Expo until closing.

Tuesday

Meet-and-greet with                 Microsoft Student Partners at 2:30pm in the Lounge area.
After that, at the Sets booth at the Expo.

Wednesday

Co-presenting a talk on Sets at 10:15am.
After grabbing some lunch, I’ll be down at the Sets booth         at the Expo.
And then joining the panel of co-presenters for the         Amplify Your Awesome talk at 4:30pm.


For times not listed above, I’ll be wandering around, or maybe hiding in the Speaker Prep room panicking. If you want to find me, you can head to the Sets booth, and if I’m not there, they can call me.
