        Microsoft dining services installed a self-service store in our building. After you complete your transaction, the kiosk reminds you to consider the environment and asks if you want a receipt. 
If you say, “No receipt”, it spits out a blank piece of paper. 
So I guess technically you didn’t get a receipt. 
(The problem has since been fixed.) 
Bonus chatter: One of my friends has an ATM at her workplace that reminds you to consider the environment and asks you if you want a receipt. If you say “Yes”, it tells you that the ATM doesn’t print receipts.
