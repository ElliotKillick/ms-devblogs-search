        Reader  Mark Eichin was  curious about the “Days with a pony” web page. Here’s what it would look (suitably redacted) if it were still operating:
  December 23, 2005: Still no pony 
 From: Raymond Chen To: Xxxx Xxxxxx Subject: Laptop order Date: Mon, 27 Mar 2000 09:47:19 -0800 
 I want a pony and a train set and an NEC Versa SX laptop (NECVS4E0E7A). 
 Maybe you can help. 
 Did I mention the pony?

 What, no pony? 

 The laptop itself is still operational, assuming you don’t need to see anything.  The LCD backlight died a few years ago, so you either have to type blind or work in a really bright room. For some reason, the video output also died, so the standard fallback of using it as a very small desktop machine (with external keyboard and monitor) doesn’t work. As a result, the machine sits in a drawer unused.
