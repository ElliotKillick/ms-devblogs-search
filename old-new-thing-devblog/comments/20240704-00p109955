Hi, thank you for this post. Really useful. I have a question through, according to the specs the Windows Runtime components can be used for UWP apps only. What about an WPF application please ? Is there anything similar that can be used please ? Thanks !

The Windows Runtime is a component ABI. It was originally created for UWP but is not restricted to it. Example of a WPF app using Windows Runtime components.
