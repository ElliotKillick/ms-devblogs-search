Unfortunately there are some cases where the API returns an error code and doesn’t give you a required buffer size, forcing you to allocate ever larger buffers. This recently bit me when using one of the NT APIs (perhaps NtQuerySystemInformation) on WoW64. It’s particularly frustrating because it invokes the native API and gets the required buffer size but just throws it away.

while (FunctionThatUsesBuffer(&buffer, &bufferSize) == ERROR_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL) {
    buffer = resize_buffer(buffer, bufferSize);
}
lol

I use this approach because I was bitten by a (I think it was network API) call that only returned the size of the buffer needed for it to be able to calculate the true size of the buffer.

And then resize_buffer() fails!..

Sure, it is. But my point is that it really breaks the beauty of the piece of code. While it could be much easier for the owner of the data we’re trying to guess the size of.
