Is there a reason to use auto&&… instead of auto&… when std::forward is not used?

If the caller passes an rvalue, then you get “Cannot bind non-const lvalue reference of type `T&` to an rvalue of type `T`.”

Can you use aggregation to implement this class?

Can you elaborate? COM aggregation would require that the wrapped IVector object support aggregation. But Platform::Collections::Vector is sealed, and winrt::multi_threaded_vector is not aggregatable.

I think something got lost in editing, the bonus method has nothing to do with moving pages.

After the first version, where did the `return` statements disappear to? There are functions declared to return something other than `void` but not containing a `return` statement – how does that work?

Given the C++20 improvements on the example, is there any hope that C++/WinRT will ever embrace C++20, including modules, given that the related tickets got closed?

AFAIK lead developer of C++/WinRT switched to Rust  (and refining Rust bindings for Windows APIs) and has no interest in working on C++/WinRT besides bugfixes. So unless someone else steps in or Microsoft decides to allocate more resources to it, it’s unlikely.

After looking at the comments on this page I had a look at the commit history for the microsoft/cppwinrt GitHub project and it seems pretty active from various users in Redmond.
