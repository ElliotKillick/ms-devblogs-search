Minor note: the correct terminology is “URI scheme” (as in the title) instead of “protocol”.  The mixup is pervasive enough that if you look on OSG’s internal wiki, on a page called “URI Schemes”, it calls out this multiple times and there’s even a dedicated section explaining why protocol is wrong.
