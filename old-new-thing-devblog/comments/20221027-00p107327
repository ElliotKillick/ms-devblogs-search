NTFS compression is also partially broken since at least Server 2022 (build 20384). Copy uncompressible (mkv, 7z) file into directory with `compressed` attribute, and it will eat twice its size of disk space, without this being at least reported in the “Size on disk” row in Properties dialog. Yes yes, it’s been added to Feedback Hub, and I’ve also spoken about it with an kernel engineer.

It's normal for compressed data to compress in an even larger amount of data. You'll always have the compression header overhead, even if it's as trivial as specifying an "uncompressed chunk" flag. If there's no way to specify uncompressed data, then you'll need the entire compression header, Huffman tables, everything required to run the decompression algorithm.

That’s the irony of filesystem compression, unless you design data for it (like for PS5, games store mostly uncompressed textures because they know the filesystem is always compressed and they have a ridiculously fast SSD and SSD controller), chances are you’re not saving much if at all for an average computer user. Most data stored on disk is compressed in some form, the major exception being executables — and they make up a minority of files on your drives.

It’s normal to detect this pathological case, and just store the original data along with the header, flagged as such. All compression formats do this.
NTFS did it too, since Windows 2000 until about Windows 10 1607 (LTSC 2016).
