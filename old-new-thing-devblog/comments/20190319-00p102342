It’s a bit annoying when a Cortana search shows the uninstaller as first result when searching the program’s name though.

Two folders in my Start Menu contain shortcuts titled only “Uninstall” (the file names are “Uninstall.lnk”, no localization tricks), and Windows 10 Pro Build 17763.rs5_release.180914-1434 isn’t hiding them. It does hide shortcuts in which “Uninstall” is followed by some other words, however.
I don’t really care whether the shortcuts appear but I’m curious why it was implemented this way.

So I wasn’t the only one who thought “this seems like an useability hazard”. I mean seriously, this is as bad as the nuke the world button in Monsters vs Ailiens.

I don’t want Microsoft to take care of my start menu!!!f a installer makes an uninstall entry I want to see this. MS isn’t smarter than me. Thanks for trying AI.

MS isn’t trying to be smarter than YOU. It’s trying to be smarter (and succeeding) than the devs who think that they need to clutter the start menu with uninstall options which can be foound in three other places.

The recommendation for a very long time has been “Don’t put shortcuts to the following items on the Start screen: Uninstallers, Help, Settings, Homepage, Wizards.” “Don’t create shortcuts to features or functionality that can be launched from within the app itself.”In Vista this became more important because of Start Menu search. In Windows 8 it became critical to reduce clutter on the Start Screen.

Why Visual Studio Installer is not affected by this behaviour?
PS.How do I re-sort the comments? Now latest coments are on the top.

My haha thought too, but it’s more of a fat “install manager”, so haha good (in my opinion). I only wish Qt’s start menu (or maybe search..  same thing) equivalent wasn’t so shy and didn’t default to the “remove all” radio option instead of upgrade / update.

I would guess because it doesn’t have ‘uninstall’ in the name. Also the VS Installer does get used much more than the typical uninstaller for adding workflows, optional components, and updating. I use it pretty frequently.

My only gripe with this is that choosing Uninstall in the context menu does not try to pre-select said program in the list of things to uninstall.
 
To make this a sure thing Microsoft could let programs define the name of their uninstall key in their manifest, or add a AppUserModelID value to the uninstall entry.

I think the idea dates back to before Windows 95.

The add/remove programs applet, if you don’t recall, was absolutely terrible and almost completely unusable until Vista; which is probably why so many programs continued to create uninstall start menu icons at the time.

That said we do still have a few well known software that you cannot uninstall at that Add/Remove Programs applet.
Say Eclipse and Sybase, just to name 2 that I just verified.

Microsoft needs a way to quarantine desktop icons added by installers.

Quick Launch still exists.  It’s just hidden by default.  First thing I do on a new installation is re-enable it.

I have a "Quick-launch-like" toolbar in Windows 10 (which I also had in Windows 7).  It's just a toolbar pointing to a folder that I created, and the folder contains shortcuts, and only the icons are displayed on the taskbar.
I didn't know that the original, official, Windows-supplied Quick Launch "still exists" in Windows 10.  It's not available as a choice to enable, under "Toolbars"... You say it's "hidden by default".  What did you do...Read moreI have a “Quick-launch-like” toolbar in Windows 10 (which I also had in Windows 7).

One of the better UI choices from MS.  Thank the team for me. 🙂
