If you’re not going to parallelise the waits then can you not just write your own background task that uses WaitForSingleObject on each handle at a time? That would avoid having to do 2n – 2 context switches.

But that would consume a thread for the duration of the wait.

Sorry, my Win32 API is rusty, I don’t remember how else to await a handle.
