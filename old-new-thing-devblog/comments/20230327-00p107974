MSBuild is so bad I’d love to cut it out of the build process, but trying to run the dotnet runtime any other way is its own pain.
Most of the actual build code is C# code inside dotnet.exe with no other entry point.

I’ve been using this approach for quite a long, especially for the NuGet package release notes.
The only downside is the file needs to be physically present in the path mentioned. So relative path needs to be carefully managed.
<PackageReleaseNotes>$([System.IO.File]::ReadAllText("$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)\release-notes.txt"))</PackageReleaseNotes>
