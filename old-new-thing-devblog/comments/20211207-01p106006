As a kid my across the street neighbors had a balloon carrying a wedding party land in their back yard.  I don’t remember them getting a bottle of champagne though.  Could’ve missed it though I was much more interested in the balloon itself than any of the people in it.

Are you sure about Françoise (feminine)?  Most references to the pair I can find have the masculine form: François.
