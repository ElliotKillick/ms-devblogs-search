I have followed your debugging tutorials for decades, and consider myself pretty decent at WinDbg… but this is some of the highest level mastery I’ve ever witnessed. The ability to just spot a magic number or the underlying organization of a library type, while chasing through stack after stack, really puts my abilities in perspective. I will strive to go deeper.

I really liked the Defrag Tools show.
