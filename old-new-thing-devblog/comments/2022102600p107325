Bonus lore: SetCursor and WM_SETCURSOR are from the times when multitasking was coöperative and multithreading did not exist (in Windows, at least).

If you pump messages and the user moves the mouse… your hourglass will be lost.
Is this the reason why I practically never see the “background hourglass” cursor?

Then i first insalled Windows NT 3.1, the whole thing just exuded power.
– the hardware cursor was smooth and responsive
– it showed full window contents while dragging
And while launching a program from Program Manager, the cursor would change to an “App Start” – the system remained responsive while a program launched in the background.
And I don’t remember seeing the app start cursor since.
