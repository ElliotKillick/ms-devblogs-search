On an unrelated note. I just read your book. Two observations. 1) I’ve never seen it from the side and I didn’t realize how many pages are in it. 2) It was such a facinating read that I’d finished it in two days. (Didn’t know that I can read this fast.)Thus a question. The book covers pre-2006 state of affairs in Windows development Do you plan on writing a sequel for 2006-2019 period?

If I was one of the original designers of the Super-H series I wouldn’t take it as a compliment knowing that my work was used for putting people to sleep 🙁
