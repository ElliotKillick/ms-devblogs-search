I did lock my car key in my car once. I had another key, which didn’t work because the other key was in the ignition lock. This was either a bug or some kind of security measure which I couldn’t comprehend.

Wow, so many people using the same workaround of printing the keys to PDF. I do it too.
I save keys to Google Drive, and the wizard refusal to save locally so I can immediately upload it is quite annoying.
I understand the wizard's intention to help me here, but really it is not helping and the message does not help people who don't understand what they are doing anyway.  It would be more helpful...Read moreWow, so many people using the same workaround of printing the keys to PDF. I do it too.

I understand the wizard’s intention to help me here, but really it is not helping and the message does not help people who don’t understand what they are doing anyway.  It would be more helpful if instead of giving that error message, it explained why it is such a bad idea, and asked user confirmation.
Say “You will not be able to recover the volume if the key is stored here. Only save it here if you immediately transfer it to a secure store” Yes/No?

My workaround.
– tell the wizard i want to “Print” my recovery key
– print it to the Microsoft PDF printer
– and tell the Microsoft PDF printer to save the PDF to the same drive it is the the recovery for

I like to save mine to OneDrive. Not to the magical hidden recovery keys page in OneDrive, but as a normal text file that syncs up to OneDrive. I always found it annoying that the wizard wouldn't let me save it to my local OneDrive synced folder, but then again I could just save it over the network to another machine. Ideally I want all my drives to be BitLocker encrypted, so this dialog always...Read moreI like to save mine to OneDrive.

Same - but to the Personal Vault of OneDrive (so Encrypted).
I still have to do the two-step process to get them there which is annoying, so I too net use a previously shared local directory on an already encrypted BitLocker data volume as per Raymond's  security vulnerability report, so that I can save "to a network location", then copy that to OneDrive.

This is a classic case of the required feature (an ability to override the warning, and allow you to do what the correctly written warning message should be warning you against doing) starts off with negative feature points, so doesn’t float to the top of the feature list.
If you know what you’re doing, why you’re doing it, it is actually safe.
I’m not saving it on an encrypted volume, I’m saving it on what appears to be an encrypted volume to you, BitLocker, but is in fact just a local shadow copy of a cloud encrypted storage that is more accessible than the hidden recovery keys page in OneDrive and is far easier to read from my phone if I need to decrypt a volume in a boot recovery scenario.  But thanks for checking.  Now let me go ahead.

The error message is abysmal anyway. Look at it:
This location can't be used. Your recovery key can't be saved to an encrypted drive. Choose a different location.
It deviates from Microsoft writing guidelines and abuses passive tense.
A better message could be:
We did not save your key to this location. Saving your recovery key on an encrypted fixed disk or the encryption target defeats the purpose of having an encryption key.

LOL!
Yes, that message is more akin to the old, terse, “gotta say something and save space”, style error messages that still linger in Windows, Office, etc. It definitely would help if it were more clear on the “WHY”.

Oh, those! I remember some of them, like “bad command or file name,” “PC LOAD LETTER,” and “lpt0 on fire.”

I always save bitlocker recovery keys to my system drive when I encrypt a system on a new PC. But I only do it so that I can open the file and copy the key into bitwarden wallet before starting the actual encryption. (And then the local copy is removed).
There has always been an easy way of doing it, though, no need for complicated setups with drive mappings - just print the recovery key...Read moreI always save bitlocker recovery keys to my system drive when I encrypt a system on a new PC.
