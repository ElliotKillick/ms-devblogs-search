Which compiler allows assignment to a temporary? VS2019 would say: “error C2106: ‘=’: left operand must be l-value”, Clang: “error: expression is not assignable”.

Huh. I never realized class types get rvalue ref-qualified assignment operators by default. So, the compiler will allow assignment if the function returns a class type, but not a fundamental one. Thanks for taking the time to make a godbolt demo.

If I were to clone the repo and try to use your helpful update, can you enlighten me about what those compatibility reasons were? Kenny did not provide any details.
For example, if it breaks in an older OS build than I’m requiring I may be able to take the change.
