As noted before, ou can fix this by authenticating the link register before jumping to the tail-called function,
typo Raymond.
I know you have them stacked up months in advance but consider this a language code review   üòâ  not a ranty fist shaking pedant
Enjoyed you on Daves show

"Bonus chatter: As I recall, callee-clean as a calling convention exists in Windows only in x86-32."
"For x86-32 ... with compact shadow stacks or hardware shadow stacks (which are compact), the return address is tracked by call depth rather than stack position, so copying a return address to a new location does not invalidate the shadow stack."

Oh fun. This means the one CPU target that can do it, the shadow stack mechanism handles it correctly. Just don‚Äôt expect using this to port anywhere.
Bonus chatter: I never had the guts to actually do this, even though I completely cheesed out the mechanism with a ROP Chain in 32 bit code (where every bogus return address was the exported _start_ of a function).
The code looks like this, and runs in rundll32.exe via a loaded library. The target OS version when written was Windows 95:
‚Äú`
push 0
push 0
push [ebp + DirectoryName]
push [ebp + fpExitProcess]
push [ebp + SelfFileName]
push [ebp + fpRemoveDirectory]
push [hInst]
push [ebp + fpDeleteFile]
push [ebp + fpFreeLibrary]
call ROPStart
mov ebp, esp
ret
ROPStart:
pop eax
ret
‚Äú`
It definitely should have been jmp [ebp + fpFreeLibrary] rather than a push/ret, but the toolchain was being unreasonably difficult. Windows 95 don‚Äôt care anyway.
