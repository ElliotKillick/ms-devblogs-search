I for one hope this function isn't removed because it is MUCH more convenient to create a file in a folder that's already open than to run the program (and wait for it to open if it's a big, bulky, bloated monster), create a new document, then slog through the Save-As dialog to re-navigate to the folder that I already had open (while trying to accidentally save in the wrong folder or accidentally close it...Read moreI for one hope this function isn‚Äôt removed because it is MUCH more convenient to create a file in a folder that‚Äôs already open than to run the program (and wait for it to open if it‚Äôs a big, bulky, bloated monster), create a new document, then slog through the Save-As dialog to re-navigate to the folder that I already had open (while trying to accidentally save in the wrong folder or accidentally close it and have to start over again) and then save the file.
This is especially true since I don‚Äôt always intend to actually create the file right there and then, often I want to create a file, give a descriptive name about what it will be, then work on it LATER.
The Xerox thing is weird. To make a new document, you have to copy an existing one, but where did the original -chicken- -egg- document come from? If a compiler is written in itself, where did its original compiler come from? Did God create himself? ü§î Who knew computers could be so existentially philosophical? ü§∑

Eg. if sharing stuff on eg. Android I will get the choice of what app i want to share with. With same logic it would make sense that New gave a choice of what app I want to use to create and open the new and empty file? I assume in most cases the user will open the new and empty file immediately after, not being happy with just having created an empty file?

This was probably a good justification 15-20 years ago, but for a very long time now this method pretty much only works for your office suit documents. For the most common files, your standard program to open images is not an image editor, the standard program to open PDFs is not a PDF editor, and the standard program to open multimedia files is not your DAW or video editor. And so on.

And so on.
This explains though why when I open up the New menu today, I only see entries for Office documents, Text files, and Photoshop. For these types of files, yes the menu choices make sense. But now there‚Äôs a discrepancy how to create new files. ‚ÄúFor these types of files you can do ‚Äòthis‚Äô [use the New menu], and for other types you have to do ‚Äòthat‚Äô [start the correct app and go from there].‚Äù
Frankly, while I do understand that you shouldn‚Äôt need to know the name of the program to open files, this does not reflect reality when creating or editing new files. You might not care or know what your standard viewer is, but people who create and edit files do know what their editor is.

I always thought of this as:
Notepad is an app for viewing and editing text files, which contain characters. It lets you delete, change, and move/copy existing characters, and also add (type) new characters.
Explorer is an app for viewing and editing folders, which contain files. So it makes sense that besides deleting, changing, and moving/copying existing files, it also lets you add (create) new files. üòä

Tangential, but germane‚ÄîI wonder at least weekly why WinOS lacks a native touch  command. (as a native cmd command, system32 exe or even something in PowerShell or pwsh). Just something easy to call on from a shell.

You can mimic touch by just setting LastWriteTime on a file in PowerShell. Would be fairly easy to alias it if you do it often enough I suspect.

I have touch.bat in my path containing:

@if exist %1 (copy /b %1+ > NUL) else (copy NUL %1 > NUL)

which handles both creating an empty file and updating the timestamp on an existing file.

I‚Äôve used copy con file.txt. Not as easy as touch and not scriptable since it requires ctrl+z to save the empty file.

Interestingly this didn‚Äôt work with COMMAND.COM which would just say ‚Äú0 file(s) copied.‚Äù; instead I believe you could use rem > file.txt (note that this doesn‚Äôt work for CMD.EXE).

REM doesn‚Äôt work, it comments out the redirection, but REN will work.

I like the "that's not what everybody does" thinking.
By that logic, why not restore the beloved Recent Items entry in the Start menu? You could even fix it, by allowing Open File location to work even if the file was renamed (after all, it is the location you want to access). Sure, you now have something similar on a per-app basis. But that's not what everybody does :)

And the beloved Quick Launch Toolbar also had one good thing that was lost with all the recent innovation: you could put many small ‚Äúlauncher‚Äù icons at predictable, immutable locations which would not jump around, and which you could access by muscle memory alone. Why not restore something similar, perhaps blending in the more powerful right-click taskbar menu options?
While I enjoy always using the latest, I so very badly miss both features of older systems.
