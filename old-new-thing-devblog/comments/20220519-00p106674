It’s been a while since I last wrote copy-paste safe code or seen it discussed.

If successive_comparisons::compare were to use std::invoke rather than requiring a direct callable, the pitfalls of the name comparison can be lessened. It does require familiarity with pointers-to-members and won’t work if T and U are actually different types. But less familiarity with decltype(auto).
