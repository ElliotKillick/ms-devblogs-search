Yet another workaround is to selectively import the operator via
using winrt::operator co_await;

As James mentioned, it’s common for standard library to put such operators into separate namespace to avoid importing whole std.
Maybe winrt can do same thing for operator await?

Rather than importing all of std::chrono just to get the literals, you can import either std::literals or std::chrono_literals.
