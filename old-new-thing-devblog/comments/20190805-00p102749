Some corrections:
1: I have never seen the floating point registers referred to as fpr_ in any official documentation, only as fr_. It's probably an invention of... wherever it is that you saw it.
2: Maybe you were planning to get into this later, but the SH-4 actually has 32 floating point registers, made up of two banks of 16 registers. The front bank is the one that's normally accessed by most floating point instructions,...Read moreSome corrections:

2: Maybe you were planning to get into this later, but the SH-4 actually has 32 floating point registers, made up of two banks of 16 registers. The front bank is the one that’s normally accessed by most floating point instructions, while the back bank is used as a 4×4 matrix. The SH-4 has a instruction that multiplies the 4×4 matrix with a 4D vector, producting a new 4D vector, in a single instruction. Very handy for 3D graphics. The floating point registers are also grouped into 4 vectors, called fv0, fv4, fv8, and fv12. The individual back bank registers are called xd0 through xd15, their double pairs are called xd0 through xd14.
3: The SH-3 was single issue, only the SH-4 was superscalar.

In honor of Raymond’s excellent series on processor instruction sets and coding for them, I wrote down a hypothetical instruction set for a hypothetical 64 bit processor. https://pastebin.com/bXkjuxhN

> Windows NT requires that the stack be kept on a 4-byte boundary.
I may be wrong (Windows CE was always a bit of a mistery zone to me, it isn’t related to NT, right?), but I suppose you mean Windows CE.

The SuperH’s were nice CPUs for the time, reasonably clean instruction set, fast, cheap, they were nice to work with.

Oh yeah, more chip stuff!

Hooray, another architecture! I had no idea that Windows had run on so many over the years.
Does the SH-3 have all the floating point registers, and just the instructions to manipulate aren't implemented? I was a little confused by the section that says they were only on the SH-4, but then could be emulated on the SH-3. (Not that I expect I'll ever need to actually debug or write code for either of them.)

There are neither floating point instructions nor registers implemented on the processor. The kernel stores the floating point registers in RAM.

The later version Raymond mentions, the SH-3e, had floating point hardware, but the original SH-3 didn’t.
It looks like (maybe only some of) the HP Jornadas used the SH-3; I had an HP 4705 in 2005, but it used an Intel ARM CPU.
