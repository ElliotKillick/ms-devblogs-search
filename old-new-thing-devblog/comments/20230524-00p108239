Same thing with Version.dll – had to rename to something like Revision.dll due to “kernel failed” like exceptions. Probably a good half of System32 directory libraries` names would cause problems.

I would bet that “security” was a less common name at the time.

In general, I’d use `#include “security.h” in your example and/or bring it closer to the real scenario (where the double quotes means search including local paths; the angle brackets means “search only system include directories”)

The angle brackets will instruct the compiler to search all include directories, which include the system include directories but also any directories specified with command line options such as . The double quotes instruct the compiler to first search the directory the file being compiled resides in, but then if not found, it will fall back to the include directories regardless.

Most build systems provide options to specify “additional include directories” when compiling a target. It’s very tempting to add the location of your own project’s header files to that list. What it does is it adds that location to the compiler’s include directory list, meaning it will now be searched when you do either a #include "..." or a #include <...>. But that’s not necessary; you can include your own project headers using the double quotes even without adding that directory to the include directories, and when you want to use system headers, you use the angle brackets and there won’t be the issue of your own headers shadowing homonymous system headers.
Of course, the issue with not adding your own project headers to the include directories is that it’s only feasible for projects using a flat layout; for projects using split include/ and src/ directories and a complex directory hierarchy under src/, not adding include/ to the include directories means you will need to write, depending on the level under src/ you’re in, varying numbers of ../ to reference files under include/. In that case, it’s better to add include/ to the include directories, but you should create a single subdirectory under include/ named after your project, and put all your headed files under that subdirectory. This way, you minimize the chance your own header files collide with header files provided by the system as well as third parties.
