This has been a huge nightmare at work.  I hate apps that actually look at that value.  Sometimes at work my PC reports as offline (or maybe subnet local) even though it is perfectly connected.
Most apps ignore the flag and simply work, but Office flatly refuses to function.

I just seem to get 0x40 from both NA_Internet­Connectivity­V4 and NA_Internet­Connectivity­V6  but I suppose I’m doing something wrong.

I would imagine if you're trapped in a captive portal but one that does not trap Microsoft servers that makes things extra fun since the captive portal won't be detected but connections to any non-MS server will fail.

I’ve seen this happen on some public wifi on Android where Google IPs are unblocked for some reason but everything else goes to the captive portal (I want to say it was McDonald’s but I’m not sure). I can only assume they are trying to force you to use a web browser to navigate to the captive portal so they can dump you on their website after you sign in (Android’s captive portal interface closes itself once it detects the portal is no longer captive), but in practice it just breaks all your non-web browser apps that need server connectivity to work. But more likely they just set up their captive portal wrong somehow.
I would think a more reliable approach would be to try to randomly generate a domain name, try to resolve it, and if it actually resolves, assume you’re in a captive portal. But there must be some reason this is not done (maybe millions of devices polluting DNS server caches with garbage?). Maybe having deterministic randomness so everyone uses the same fake domain and it rotates every day? (I suppose hackers could predict domains, register them, and try to exploit devices which attempt to connect looking for a captive portal.)

Oh oops this is actually done in Chrome, though not for detecting captive portals.
Go search “chrome dns hijacking detection” for more info.

One captive portal vendor I’ve seen offers a mode where you can download “security updates” without signing in, which claims to unblock IPs needed to let connected devices download OS and application updates from device vendors. I wouldn’t be surprised if enabling that caused portal detection to fail because it lets you through to the vendor’s IPs (Google, Apple, Microsoft etc) but not to the wider Internet.
