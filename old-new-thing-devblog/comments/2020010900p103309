Did you put the wrong diagram by mistake? The diagram in use isn’t of a binary tree (B, C and D are all children of A).

I’m stunned by the fact that none of these required keeping more state than the single cursor.

Well it needs the tree to be doubly linked (parents have links to children, and children have links to parents too), which isn’t the case of the “naïve” tree example.
If you follow a more “state machine” approach, you need a little more state, such as having both the current node and the previous one (to know whether you are coming from the parent, or a child, and which one).

That surprised me too!
