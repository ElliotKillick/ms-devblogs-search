Cue a spate of companies giving their files extensions being with a and 1 for no good reason…

I'm glad there are third-party editors for the "New Menu", so I can remove some of these entries.  Why would anyone create a new BMP file by right-clicking an empty space in a folder?  You still need a BMP editor to put anything meaningful in there.  The same is true for a PowerPoint presentation, and an Access database.

But if I want to create a new PowerPoint presentation, I will … um… open Powerpoint.

I prune my “new menu” as well but I still use it to create .txt files all the time and it is faster. You use the new menu when you already have a Explorer window open on the desired folder. New menu->.txt, Rename, Double-click vs Open/switch to Editor, Ctrl+S, navigate to the folder in the save dialog, type name, click OK.

Yes, I use the “New” menu to create text files myself… along with Excel and Word files.  There’s really nothing else I need in the New menu.  New contact?  That’s not useful for me.  I don’t have Contacts scattered around in various Windows folders….

New Issue: Change our file extension to .a11
We need to make sure that our awesome file extension shows up first on the New shell menu in File Explorer. According to Microsoft Executive Raymond Chen, the way to guarantee our awesome file comes up first, we have to come alphabetically before any competitors in order to be first on the list.

But why does it not display the extensions in the menu when you have the "show file extensions" option turned on? The statusbar in 2000&XP displays a help text for folder and shortcut but nothing for the other items. "New" Explorer does not display any menu text in the statusbar.
Almost on topic: The send to menu sometimes has a bug where some of the menu items are aligned incorrectly. Probably related to menu icon changes...Read moreBut why does it not display the extensions in the menu when you have the “show file extensions” option turned on?
