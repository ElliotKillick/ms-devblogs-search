Sounds like an Internet-connected toaster.  I know!  Let's put a computer in the toaster, instead of dumb controls.  That way, there are more points of failure!
I wish ALL clocks had a button that adds one hour, and a button that removes one hour.  Or a plus-one-hour/minus-one-hour two-position slide switch.  A few clocks do, but most do not.  Sure, that won't help when your DST time shifts by 30 minutes,...Read moreSounds like an Internet-connected toaster.  I know!  Let‚Äôs put a computer in the toaster, instead of dumb controls.

Or, better yet, get rid of DST altogether.

Or an IoT fridge.  I recall looking at the refrigerators at the local big-box home-improvement store and saw a fridge with a tablet built into the door.  They had it display the local time, weather forecast, ews, etc.  As though I don't have a TV for the morning news, or a tablet, or a laptop, or a phone... And you had a ~1500 USD premium for that "privilege".  Just to have...Read moreOr an IoT fridge.

Just to have a soon-to-be-outdated tablet embedded in your fridge.  And what would you do if (when) the tablet breaks?  Likely a service call, because it‚Äôs unlikely that it‚Äôd be a user-servicable part.  Something tells me that it‚Äôd be an expensive service call.  I think I‚Äôll stick with my well-insulated but non-connected fridge, thanks.  Ditto for connected clocks.

Talking about IOT-toaster, I'm curious if there is automatic toast maker instead.
In here, lots of people are having their breakfast in cafe where they use online App to take orders already. It'll be kind of WOW-factor if we can see a machine that while I make the order, it cuts a slice of bread, run the bread through the heating wires with conveyor belt to make it a toast, then drop butter/peanut butter/jam/nutella or whatever...Read moreTalking about IOT-toaster, I‚Äôm curious if there is automatic toast maker instead.

Sounds like overengineered BS. I bought atomic clocks ‚Äì manual that runs on 1 AA and digital clocks that change date and time over the air via NIST (Colorado, CO). They cost me anywhere from $15 to $20 on Amazon. I replaced clocks in our conference rooms but use a wall adapter so batteries never need to be replaced. The time will adjust automatically whenever day light savings start or ends.

One of my friends has an atomic clock. His problem is that the signal is poor in the room, so whenever the time changes, he has to unplug the clock, go to another room, plug it in, let it sync the time, and then move back to the original room.

My wife‚Äôs alarm clock has a built in calendar and knows when daylight savings changes, except, it was made before they moved it back a week to accommodate Halloween. So now it always changes itself one week earlier than it should.

Have you tried setting your wifi router / AP to only broadcast 2.4 Ghz? Some of these automated wifi things get tripped up when the 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz radios have the same SSID. I had this problem when connecting my new fancy Philips wifi lightbulbs that took a whole hour to configure.
Here's the info from the WiZ FAQ page that pointed me in the right direction (https://taolight.helpshift.com/a/wiz/?s=getting-started&f=pairing-troubleshooting&l=en):

Some of these automated wifi things get tripped up when the 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz radios have the same SSID. I had this problem when connecting my new fancy Philips wifi lightbulbs that took a whole hour to configure.
Here‚Äôs the info from the WiZ FAQ page that pointed me in the right direction (https://taolight.helpshift.com/a/wiz/?s=getting-started&f=pairing-troubleshooting&l=en):
2 ‚Äì Check that your phone is connected to the 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi on your home router.
2.4GHz is the Wi-Fi band used by the lamps because it covers more distance than 5GHz. Your phone has to be on 2.4GHz Wi-Fi so that the pairing works. If your router does not distinguish between 5GHz and 2.4GHz, you may need to check inside the router settings (http://192.168.1.1/ ).
If you do not know which network you are on, go check your router settings, your router probably gives the same name to both 2.4GHz and 5GHz networks. You probably need to go into ‚ÄúAdvanced Wi-Fi Settings‚Äù and check a checkbox saying ‚Äúhave different SSID for each network‚Äù (or something equivalent). Then, rename your 5GHz network by adding ‚Äú-5GHz‚Äù at the end. Now, in your phone list of available networks, you should see one named ‚Äúmy wi-fi name‚Äù and one named ‚Äúmy wi-fi name -5GHz‚Äù. Choose the one without 5GHz, it will therefore be the 2.4GHz one. The lamps get the credentials of your router via a protocol named UDP. Please check that UDP is not blocked on your network in your router settings.

I have three! (Well, one‚Äôs a watch.) I should really go and reset the time on my legacy clocks at some point.

Your alarm clock likely uses something like ESP-Touch or Airkiss for provisioning. The way it works is, the SSID/password are encoded in packet lengths, then the device sniffs the encrypted packets to decode the enrollment data. This only works well if (a) your phone is using 2.4GHz band, because most of those Internet-of-Shit crap doesn't support 5GHz and (b) your phone has the strongest signal nearby, because that's how automatic channel detection works in the...Read moreYour alarm clock likely uses something like ESP-Touch or Airkiss for provisioning.

So, temporarily disable 5GHz on the router(s) and make sure your phone is closer to the alarm clock than any other WiFi device during setup.

Almost the same thing happened to me today: I tried to download Windows Admin Center 1910, but I was taken to Microsoft Evaluation Center of all places and told to create an account and fill a form.
I didn‚Äôt download Windows Admin Center 1910. It is as broken as your clock.

That‚Äôs why not everything should be IOT-ed.
In fact I don‚Äôt want most of the things that I used be IOT-ed.

If your system clock is too far behind, SSL certificates will fail validation. I suspect during QA the certificates were valid for the reset date, but the current certificate is not.

Just the other day I got a thermometer (the medical kind) that needs an app to take a measurement. Grudgingly, I installed an app, and of course the first thing it asked was to log into an account. So I signed up as ‚ÄúJohn Doe‚Äù with the ‚Äúfuckyou@gmail.com‚Äù email address. Lo and behold, somebody else had already used that email address.
I‚Äôm going back to my 20-year old dumb thermometer from Walgreens.
