Rant: The last desktop monitor with a reasonable pixel density was released in 2015. (DELL 2415U, 4K, 23.8″, which puts it roughly at 200%.) Since then, things have mostly gone downhill. (4K @ 27″ ≈ 175% or 7:4.)
And the point of 200% is that every pixel of a standard 96 DPI bitmap perfectly scales to a 2×2 block without any need for interpolation.

I will never understand – what’s the point of having a large high resolution screen if Windows scales everything up so that a 32″ 4k screen displays the same amount of information as a 21″ HD screen?  Yes, I know it can be overriden manually, but the whole idea is fundamentally flawed plus it gives software developers a serious headache.

As resolution goes up, things are supposed to get sharper, not smaller.

The intention is that UI elements remain the same physical size on all screens (subtending the same angle), based on the physical size of the screen and the expected distance to the viewer.
The primary purpose of higher DPI is for fonts and other elements to be 'sharper' - less pixellated, less use of antialiasing - and thus easier to read.
Not to display more information.

If you don’t want to deal with any of that, the operating system just upscales the whole application so that it remains the original size the developer intended.
You only get into trouble when an application deliberately tells the OS it understands Hi-DPI and needs the native, when it does not in fact understand it.

There is no point in a 32″ 4K. The reasonable size for 4K is 24″, and 32″ should be 5K. (Assuming the screen distance of one standard arm’s length.)

The best scale depends on how the screen identifies itself, as well as the actual size of the screen.
TVs are intended to be viewed from further away, so the scale gets bumped up so you can still read the text. If you're viewing a TV from the same distance that you'd view a monitor, then yes, you need to change your setting. But if your device says it's a TV, with an intended DPI, AFAIK,...Read moreThe best scale depends on how the screen identifies itself, as well as the actual size of the screen.

Opposite is true, too. If I have a 4K screen on a laptop, I need that scale bumped up to read it.

So I have a question closely related to this. How does Windows decide what to recommend? On my 28″ 4K display it recommends 150% (reasonable), but on my 43″ 4K display it recommend 300% (not reasonable). A 43″ display has ~96dpi so 100% is perfect.

A 43″ TV is supposed to be used from afar so the effective resolution is supposed to be lower in order to get the bigger elements and text you need for it to be usable from that distance.
