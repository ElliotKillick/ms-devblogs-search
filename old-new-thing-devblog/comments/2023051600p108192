“ATL is the only one whose & operator does not release the pointer before producing the address.”
Note: In debug mode the operator& asserts if the smart pointer is still holding a reference. The source has a comment:
    //The assert on operator& usually indicates a bug.  If this is really
    //what is needed, however, take the address of the p member explicitly.

Pity that C++/CX types for COM and Windows Runtime were left out of this overview, the only usable approach to be productive in COM while using C++.

You can’t use C++/CX or Windows Runtime smart pointers for things that aren’t Windows Runtime types, so the table would be very simple: “Not possible (duck typing not supported).”
