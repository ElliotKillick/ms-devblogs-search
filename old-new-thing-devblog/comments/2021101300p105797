co_await p.final_suspend();
destruct promise p
destruct parameters in coroutine frame
destroy coroutine state
what about if it adjust below?
destruct parameters in coroutine frame
co_await p.final_suspend();
destruct promise p
destroy coroutine state
Can the promise object access parameters later? if it can’t, I think that adjust isn’t problem.

The promise constructor is given references to the copied parameters, so it can save those references and use them in its destructor.

In C++, you generally think of parameters and local variables as equivalent.
I seriously doubt anyone does that. Local variables cause compilation errors. Parameters cause bugs that make you want to pull your hair out.
