It was probably made by an eBay seller.
A video-game that was made 10 years ago and sold 10,000,000 copies and says “bestseller” right on the box is neither “vintage” nor “rare”. ¬_¬

That’s not the Motly Fool either. That’s someone using the name of a defunct investors’ advice column to pump and dump.

The Motley Fool is a company (http://www.fool.com, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Motley_Fool).  It started as an investor’s advice column and has grown into a somewhat well-known company (Wikipedia says it has 300 employees).  It provides investment “advice” and those “rare” alerts that Raymond is making fun of.  It also includes weekly columns in newspapers (periodic compendia of paper-based web pages), and a few other things.

Likewise are those stores which claims they offer rare discount because they’re going to shutdown, while “they are shutting down everyday” since my childhood, going on like 20+ years.

Right up there with Business Insider’s never ending series on the things Millennials are supposedly killing.  🙄
