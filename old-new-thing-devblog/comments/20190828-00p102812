It seems that we’ve entered “What Microsoft has done to reduce product size in the past” week.
Any story to share on things like, “self extracting EXE” like the one used in Norton Utilities or so?

surely using the preprocessor to make code conditional would have been better than the __if_exists and __if_not_exists keywords

This doesn’t work:

template<typename T>
struct Generator
{
  T Generate{)
  {
#if defined(T::VerifyAccess)
    T::VerifyAccess();
#endif
    return T();
  }
};

Today, we would use SFINAE to invoke the VerifyAccess method if it exists. In 1996, no such luck.

I wanted to be sure I understood what __if_exists does and found docs that say:
"The __if_exists statement tests whether the specified identifier exists. If the identifier exists, the specified statement block is executed."
Surely they mean "compiled", not "executed", right? This is a compile-time mechanism. While the code block will be executed as well, you point out in your article here:

“And that’s when they discover some of the truly insane things people have done with it, like putting code inside an __if_exists block that do not even form a complete C++ construct.”
I enjoy your posts as I lived (and wrote code) through many of these past eras you cover.
