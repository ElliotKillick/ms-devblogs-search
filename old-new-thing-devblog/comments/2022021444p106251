We do not pass the actual buffer until we call Finish_Pull.  The marshaller has no knowledge of how many bytes Pull is going to access past the buffer pointer, so how does it pass the correctly sized array to Pull?

The marshaller knows that it’s 100 bytes because the buffer parameter is annotated in the IDL with size_is: [out, size_is(cRequest), length_is(*pcReturned)].
