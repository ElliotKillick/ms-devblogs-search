Thanks for these articles.
Please, note that in your “Property” table, the only difference should be in “Static members”.
As for “Different awaitable type depending on parameter types”, you show how CTAD can be used in future articles, so “struct” should also be “Yes”.
As for “Warn if not co_awaited”, C++20 allows applying [[nodiscard]] to constructors (as a DR), so again, “struct” should also be “Yes”.
