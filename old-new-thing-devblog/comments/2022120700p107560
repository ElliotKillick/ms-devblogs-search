My guess for the exercise would be because the customer had not included ANY Windows::UI::Xaml namespaced code via headers, but had included other Windows::UI namespaces. So the compiler found Windows, Windows::UI, but failed to find Windows::UI::Xaml so stopped there.
Sure. the compiler could go “I also couldn’t find Media or Imaging inside the first thing I couldn’t find.” but at that point it’s redundant.
