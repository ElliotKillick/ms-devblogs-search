A great read.  It sounds like you had a good visit.  Really appreciate the travel tips – I aspire to actually use them one day in the coming years.  It’s this sort of “inside knowledge” which would make me calm in the face of huge lines & queues, as well as knowing it’s not the end of the world to miss something.
