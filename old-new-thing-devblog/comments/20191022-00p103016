>At least, that’s what it used to do. You can try it yourself on Windows 95. But it doesn’t seem to work in Windows 10. Not sure if that’s a bug or a feature.
Alt+F6 functionality disappeared several versions of Windows ago, it's not a Windows 10 difference as far as I'm aware. I've no idea why it went away.

Alt+F6 works in 2000 and XP and does not work in 8 so it stopped working in 2003 (unlikely), Vista, 7 or 8.

My current company still uses Win7 and I can confirm it does not work here, so it’s either Vista or 7.
