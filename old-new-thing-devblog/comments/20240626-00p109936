> Partly because it’s hoping that the C++ language will provide reflection.
Yeah, since 2016, that was the lame excuse for not providing C++/CX level of quality tooling in Visual Studio for C++/WinRT, which keeps the whole experience of using C++/WinRT in Visual Studio back to Visual C++ 6.0 with ATL, but it seems that is what Windows developer team really likes, and cannot understand why we would enjoy anything else.

Be it in logs, or in an error alert/dialog, I agree, integer codes are required. But also presenting a string description can hasten the diagnose. Just be sure to always show the error code, and then, if available, the description. That way, logs can be easily parsed but retain their readability, and dialogs are useful for the technical audience (the description gives a quick glance at the problem, and the code can be looked up...Read moreBe it in logs, or in an error alert/dialog, I agree, integer codes are required.

That way, logs can be easily parsed but retain their readability, and dialogs are useful for the technical audience (the description gives a quick glance at the problem, and the code can be looked up on an article or a knowledge database to get more detailed information).
Anyway, the dialogs have to be carefully designed, so not to scare the user. Maybe the usual “An error has happened while saving.” and then a “Details” button which expands a panel with the technical information. Or some kind of master-detail design. But here we are entering the fields of usability.
