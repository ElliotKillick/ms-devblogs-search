The empty list requiring an allocation is not just a minor annoyance, it’s at least a medium annoyance: it means that move construction needs to allocate, which means list is not nothrow-movable. This is a major performance pessimization for a vector of lists, and a correctness issue for a variant of lists (could be empty_due_to_exception).

Forgive some dumb questions. Are you writing these posts in one day, or did you queue them up? These diagrams aren’t images, they’re `table`s and `pre`s with Unicode arrows. Impressive. How are you making them?

There is a queue. He probably has a couple of months of prepared posts.
You can try to guesstimate the queue size with posts that start with “Recently/A while back NAME asked QUESTION (link to old post)”.
