I think I found a potential bug of Googleâ€™s WebRTC project:
https://webrtc.googlesource.com/src/+/3fcd31c4e52957ca0c411f73fb56e7f8929d3697/api/scoped_refptr.h#121
  scoped_refptr& operator=(T* p) {
    // AddRef first so that self assignment should work
    if (p)
      p->AddRef();
    if (ptr_)
      ptr_->Release();
    ptr_ = p;
    return *this;
  }
