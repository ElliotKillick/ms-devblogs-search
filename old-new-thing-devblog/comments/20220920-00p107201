Apparently we are still paging out the kernel in 2022.
Maybe its time to consider a setting that means “don’t page the kernel”.

Note that the original post begins with “A colleague of mine shared a story from Windows XP product support.”

Yes, I know which "major computer manufacturer" it is, and no, I’m not telling. This is consistent with longstanding blog policy that companies are not identified in stories, because the point of the story [is] to teach something, not to call out companies for derision.

And yet this blog post and its previous episode violated said policy. You named the perpetrator, i.e., Janet Jackson. By failing to name the victim, whose business was disrupted through no fault of its own, you removed the element of verifiability. Who would deride victims? Has anyone ever derided the victims of the Jacksonville Landing shooting for being shot or injured?

You have a really strange idea of who is the "victim" and who is the "perpetrator" here. Janet is the victim: she would get blamed for causing the crashes and whatever harm resulted from them, when in fact the fault was with the manufacturer for building a system that could be damaged by a resonant frequency its own speakers were perfectly capable of producing. Unless you're implying that someone associated with Janet deliberately chose the...Read moreYou have a really strange idea of who is the “victim” and who is the “perpetrator” here.

Janet Jackson did nothing wrong but I also don’t see how her business was disrupted. I really doubt this impacted her sales of said music.
I believe the policy came about to discourage discussions about certain programs that would take over all file associations and add themselves to quick launch etc. This blog is hosted by Microsoft so why certain restrictions apply is easy to understand.

If anything, I’d say that the firestorm of chatter unleashed by Raymond’s post only increased public awareness, and likely sales, of Rhythm Nation.

That’s because you completely misread and misunderstood my comment. You do this to everyone here. The brain inside your head is truly wasted on you. That’s assuming you’re not a bot and actually have a brain instead of an AI.

So a few notes:
Resonance frequency still matters. If you examine datacenter hard drives they are often rated for the number of drives that can be in the same enclosure of the same type. This is because they will naturally produce some amount of near resonant frequency which could potentially cause issues. The manufacturers certify them up to a certain point. A quick search shows that you pay more for drives that are certified for "unlimited"...Read moreSo a few notes:

This is because they will naturally produce some amount of near resonant frequency which could potentially cause issues. The manufacturers certify them up to a certain point. A quick search shows that you pay more for drives that are certified for “unlimited” per enclosure.
There are likely still affected drives in circulation and active use too, which is an important callout. As I type this I’m sitting a few feet away from one such plausible drive from ~2012 approx. However it’s in a business class laptop I use for testing and is isolated with rubber cozy internally. The fact I only every RDP into that machine and never actually use its speakers probably also helps.
I’m going to make a radical guess and assume that “major computer manufacturer” contacted “major hard drive manufacturer” and this was likely fixed in a later rev of the hardware. When you’re buying millions of the things you have enough pull to get fixes like that but they have long lead times and would cost too much to delay for. So this likely won’t affect anything made at least two years after. Why only “likely”? Because the “major computer manufacturer” probably had a lot of inventory from “major hard drive manufacturer” to sell first. Regardless I don’t see “major computer manufacturer” not addressing such a risk, it could be way too costly if a well meaning engineer removed the filter later when Vista came out and changed how the sound driver stack worked. Obviously they could have carried it forwards but I’m going to guess they didn’t since it was probably everybody’s installed “major audio HD Codec manufacturer” and writing a custom driver is a pain in the butt when you can just use the one from the original manufacturer of the chip.
