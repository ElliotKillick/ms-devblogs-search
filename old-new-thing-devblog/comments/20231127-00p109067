I’ve recently tested this under 95 and the results depend highly on drivers. Many will have problems and show wrong colors, especially when using anything more than VGA. I had good results with a Trio64, but still, the performance was inadequate for games.
BTW, I’m curious, whether it’s possible on Windows 9x to run an MS-DOS application that plays music in the background. I’ve tried several options and it would only work in the foreground.

“Windows 3.1 could not run graphical MS-DOS programs in a window”
This is not true.

Right. I remember running GEM 1.0 in a Window under Windows 3.1. It was possible selecting the CGA video driver, which meant that GEM ran at 640x200, in monochrome, with those hideous 1:2 pixels. And, of course, it required a screen resolution of at least 800x600. But it definitely did run.
What Windows 95 did was to add support for EGA and VGA modes (640x200, 640x350 and 640x480 at 16 colors, and 320x200/240 at 256 colors)...Read moreRight.

That is also the reason why I wasn’t able to run GEM in 16 colors under Windows 3.1. GEM 1.0 had a driver for the then (back in 1985) top-of-the-line EGA, but Windows 3.1 didn’t support it in windowed mode.
