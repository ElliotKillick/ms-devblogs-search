It would be amusing to try to find some means to interpret Raymond’s post as a means of predicting the price of some future Microsoft product.  However, based on Raymond’s post, some journalist would probably post my comment as pricing news.

All of journalism is trash. You only notice it when they write on a subject you have expertise in.
