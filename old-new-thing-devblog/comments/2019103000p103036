The whole shutdown screen is a bad misfeature. Has been for 10 years already.
How about allowing to go back to the desktop to the offending app (which if most likely on a ‚Äúsave this file?‚Äù dialog, and to respond to the app, to allow the shutdown proceed?

This seems like a situation where a quick grep over the codebase for A[^\W] would‚Äôve worked reasonably well to find problematic code.
It‚Äôs always obvious in hindsight.

So that‚Äôs the story behind the bug I‚Äôve been seeing. And nice to see more information on who to blame. Is this just this specific case, or for all situations?

Not sure what you mean ‚Äúall situations‚Äù. This certainly doesn‚Äôt cover all situations of an app preventing shutdown. This is just fixing the mystery ‚ÄúG‚Äù.

I meant for displaying the executable name in this particular screen.

This fixes the title of the window formerly known as ‚ÄúG‚Äù. Other windows are unaffected. If you want to change the Blocked Shutdown Resolver screen itself, then I encourage you file a Feedback Hub item, or find Alex‚Äôs and upvote it.

Does this mean that it will likely be included in the Fall 2019 update, or is it already pushed out towards future updates?

I don‚Äôt know if this is a good idea, but what if the BSDR showed the file description from the image of the window‚Äôs owning process? Isn‚Äôt that what Task Manager does?

I am all in favor of filing an item in Feedback Hub and upvoting it heavily.
