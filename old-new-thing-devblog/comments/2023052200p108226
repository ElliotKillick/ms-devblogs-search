I would bet that the reason for the before-or-after behaviour is to support iterating in reverse order? (rbegin/rend) It may also be for he benefits of some standsard algorithm that happen to need that behaviour? If all three implemented it is either because one did and the otehr would seem slower if they did not, or that my hunch about algorithms is right and all three implementations realized it.
