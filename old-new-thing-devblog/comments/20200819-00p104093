qq: “But the whole point of a memory-mapped file is to be cached in memory!”
Aehm. Sometimes?
The whole point for me always was that I could access the file like a memory region, thereby not having to care about the data being backed by a file.
Obviously, you kinda need to cache it in memory to implement this, but that isn’t the point for me.

Using FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING with a memory-mapped file doesn’t really serve any purpose.
Realy?
But I have repeatedly seen sequential read by mmap with FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING and without FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING behave differently.
