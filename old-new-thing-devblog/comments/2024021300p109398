Our security class professor at university once said: you don’t need complicated methods to hack many educated people. Just ask them for their password and they will give it to you.
The problem is many people don’t understand basic security concepts in digital space. Maybe because digital world is abstract and they have a hard time thinking about abstractions.

"Domain Administrator user logs on to compromised machine" was one of the fundamental steps in the 2009 "Aurora" attacks against Google and many other companies.
Turns out a lot of organizations were running their automation scripts -- the ones that tried to check patch status and security posture for their fleet -- remotely by authenticating as a domain admin. Oops! Hope everyone got the memo and no one still does that today.

This is in fact the downside of single sign-on via passwords.
Modern Unix doesn’t have this problem for remote access only because of widespread use of SSH keys.
Preventing this issue with local access doesn’t seem to be possible by any reasonable transform. Even if you went full Harvard Architecture I can see it falling if you make it worth the expense.
