> Another more significant difference for the purpose of the story is that on half-height drives, opening the latch ejected the floppy disk from the drive
I‚Äôve only ever used half-height 5.25‚Ä≥ drives, and none of them ejected the floppy when you unlatched them ‚Äì you had to reach in and pull it out.

If you wanted to play music from your floppy disk than instead of streaming it you might want to deliberately fragment your file so that your drive has to seek backwards and forwards to read it? Well, maybe you wouldn‚Äôt quite get the same results as people do these days by hooking up their floppy drives to a Raspberry Pi‚Ä¶

A question about the linked article on Win95 almost floppy detection algorithm.
The article explains why the various strategies for training were prohibitive but doesn't mention the strategy of "wait until the first time the drive is read from successfully, at that point we know a disk is present, so quickly run the algorithm", why wasn't this approach taken?

Sadly all the comments were lost in the great blog migration, but (b) was essentially the reason. IMO another factor is likely that few programs would take advantage of this feature: floppies were already starting to disappear as an installation medium by this time, and older programs wouldn‚Äôt know about this ability (and so would still require you to press the ‚ÄúANY‚Äù key to continue!)

It would have been at least good enough to know when to clear the cache through, wouldn‚Äôt it?

Oh, the old joke regarding somebody insist on finding a key labeled ‚ÄúAny‚Äù on the keyboard, so they mailed him a label printed ‚ÄúAny‚Äù on it and make him paste it on the spacebar.
You want it, you get it.

Btw, any story on the idea regarding ‚ÄúPress any key to continue‚Äù?
Yeah technically most of the keys on keyboard will let you continue (I think Ctrl-C will not work when you set ‚Äúbreak on‚Äù‚Ä¶ ‚Äúbreak on‚Äù and ‚Äúverify on‚Äù are another set of old memories), but why not be more specific and say ‚ÄúPress Enter to continue‚Äù or ‚ÄúPress space to continue‚Äù?

I‚Äôve never used the word ‚Äúany‚Äù in such a prompt for that reason.  At one point, I saw a program where the developer was thinking ahead and more specifically prompted ‚ÄúType a character to continue‚Äù and I adopted that practice. üôÇ

Most likely, the answer is ‚Äúthe programmer didn‚Äôt think ‚Äòany key‚Äô would confuse people, because it means, you know, any key.‚Äù

There ought to be a name for this practice of laughing at how slow (or small, or whatever) technology was back in the olden days. Retro-gloating? Reverse-tech-envy?

My next door neighbor in the late 80s had an 8‚Ä≥ drive.  The disks looked like regular 5 1/4‚Ä≥s, except they were comically bigger.  At the time, all I really messed with was Commodore, so 8‚Ä≥ drives and 4k *colors* (I had another neighbor with an Atari ST) were very exotic things to me.

The IBM PC‚Äôs floppy controller only ran at 250 kbits per second. The megabit floppy controller didn‚Äôt arrive until 1991 along with the 2.88 MB drive.
It is a good thing that side switch toggles never took hold on the IBM PC. That treats a double sided disk as a pair of single sided disks and instantly swaps the active side. Would have wrecked the cache delay logic.

A couple of things. First I thought Sony and Phillips did get the audio CD out in time for the 5150 PC. I was wrong. According to Wikipedia they missed it by a whole year. But the point is still somewhat valid because Microsoft did push CD-ROM technology on machines of that vintage.
My other thought was that IIRC 5 1/4‚Ä≥ floppy disk sectors were interleaved so it takes two or three rotations to read a single track.

Interleaving is to give the CPU time to process one sector before delivering the next one. So yes, I‚Äôm also assuming an infinitely fast CPU that can process sectors as fast as they arrive from the controller.
