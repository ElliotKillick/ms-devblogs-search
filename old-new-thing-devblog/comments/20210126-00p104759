I‚Äôve been wiggling the mouse to make scrolling go faster in various programs for decades. I don‚Äôt think I ever really thought about why it does that. ü§î It‚Äôs just like how I‚Äôve always intuitively strafe-run in video-games without thinking about the underlying code. ü§∑
In some programs, I use the scroll-wheel to scroll faster while dragging stuff than the auto-scroll will go on its own.

Bug dependence stinks. https://superuser.com/q/1620933/71189 The horror it‚Äôs just too much.

Sometimes when selecting text on a page you need to wiggle the mouse to scroll at all.  Select and drag, it scrolls for a bit and then suddenly stops.  Beyond that point you need to constantly wiggle the mouse to get the scrolling to continue.

Indeed. That‚Äôs so much pain to select multi-page text without wiggling your mouse.

The wiggle-to-scroll-faster ‚Äúfeature‚Äù is helpful as a workaround for the lack of an intended way to speed up the scroll, but you could be nicer and give the users more control by calibrating the scroll speed to how far outside the area they‚Äôve moved the mouse.
Bonus points if you can somehow detect that they‚Äôre trying to move down further even if the mouse is actually at the bottom of the screen already!
