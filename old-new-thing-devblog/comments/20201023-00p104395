I found code (earlier) that used StorageDeviceTrimProperty to detect SSD (e.g search stackoverflow). Is StorageDeviceSeekPenaltyProperty more reliable?

This is discussed in the article. It depends on why you are checking for SSD.

“Many people cheat even further and also assume that the volume is mounted as a drive letter.”
These people are why we can‘t have nice things.

This could be useful for games to be able to tell if the drive the game is being installed to is an SSD or not and if its not, show a recommendation that an SSD be used. (many games these days say “we recommend you install this to an SSD”)

Speaking of RAM drives. I have seen RAM drives that only have a drive letter and not a volume GUID. That was back on XP, not sure if the volume manager would allow that these days.

Isn’t the volume GUID assigned only when the volume is on “GPT disk”? I think most people were on “basic disk”(MBR disk) during WinXP days so that’s probably the reason behind what you see.

No I don’t think so, I’m guessing the volume manager creates this GUID. Perhaps with GPT it uses the GUID on the disk.
Volume GUIDs were added in 2000 when GPT was not common on x86 systems.
