I am of the mentality that an explicit null check is better if you can’t be sure that the function will crash. If the pointer is just stashed away for later then “later” is when the issue will surface, likely a long time after the error was made. Not fun to debug that situation.

I've long vascillated on this; sometimes I wonder if it's not better to return E_INVALIDARG even in-process and assume the calling function's error handler can at least mange that.  I'd assert in debug builds, because you want and need to fix the logic bug, of course, but doesn't returning an error instead of crashing provide a better user experience (sometimes) at the cost of making the bug harder to find?This is merely 'hiding' the bug...Read moreI’ve long vascillated on this; sometimes I wonder if it’s not better to return E_INVALIDARG even in-process and assume the calling function’s error handler can at least mange that.

I think the link about the difference between bugs and errors should link to the timestamp 17m13s, not 7m13s.
