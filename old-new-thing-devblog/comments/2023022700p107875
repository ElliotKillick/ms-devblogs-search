I remember that a few Win16 applications overrode the system page fault screen and tried to exit "gracefully" (i. e., closing files, saving preferences and things like that). The two I remember were media players, where there were no real danger of data corruption, but I think the feature was more like "hey, mom, look at what I have achieved!" than anything. Anyhow, maybe Windows engineers recognized the flag's use to capture a page fault...Read moreI remember that a few Win16 applications overrode the system page fault screen and tried to exit ‚Äúgracefully‚Äù (i. e., closing files, saving preferences and things like that).

Anyhow, maybe Windows engineers recognized the flag‚Äôs use to capture a page fault (which, as far as I know, could not be captured within user code in the days of Win16, maybe because Win16 kernel itself ran as a process under the virtual machine manager). If that were the case, it would make sense for the check to override other ‚Äúfinal fail‚Äù features, such as WER or dropping into the debugger.
