Hmmm,  being a sometime suspenders and a belt kind of coder, is there some way of making async-async part of a wrapper test that can point out “Hey, in function xxxxxx you spun off a doohickey that isn’t waited for properly”.    ?

The hard part is detecting when something improper was done. Consider:

var options = new WidgetStartOptions();
options.curve = curve;
var t1 = widget.StartAsync(options);
widget.ChangeColor(blue);
curve.speed = 2.0;

Was changing the widget’s color proper? What about modifying the curve’s speed?
