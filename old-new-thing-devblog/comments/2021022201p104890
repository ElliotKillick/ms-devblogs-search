I think in these situations, you simply say in your best French you can:
“Soyez arrogant, mais sans les anglophones, vous parleriez allemand, pas français.”

In Rome we once asked for bruschetta as if it were spelled “bruscetta”. The waiter repeated our mispronounced order, adding “subito!”, and then brought us just what we wanted.
In Normandy, I asked a café waitress for “un crêpe” rather than “une crêpe”, which is rather funny if you think about it, but she pretended not to understand me at all.

On visits to France i find starting with “Bonjour” followed by “pardon” and the rest in English seems to work. If they blank you say “pute de con” or “putain” and walk away.

I haven't been here in years. I was looking at a blog post about "Environment Variable Expansion" I found in a batch file. Funny that I would come across this post. Is that third story about Andrew C? Did he tell you himself? (I remember he would tell everybody that story - it's a good story).
Thanks for the trip down memory lane. And RIP Andrew.

Btw, this reminds me about something that one of my English teacher in secondary school told us about when being asked "why we're told to use different words and not repeating the use if possible? Is that just to show off you know a lot of vocabularies?"
When talking in English, since lots of English words carry more than one different meaning, it help to use different vocabularies to convey the same idea to people who...Read moreBtw, this reminds me about something that one of my English teacher in secondary school told us about when being asked “why we’re told to use different words and not repeating the use if possible?

When talking in English, since lots of English words carry more than one different meaning, it help to use different vocabularies to convey the same idea to people who you’re talking to in order to converge the idea to what you really want to talk about, so as to minimize the chance of misunderstanding.

On “parapluie”: if the “p” is not aspirated, one might mistake it for a “b” instead, so it could become “parabluie”.
On “une vanille et une chocolat”: I can see this comes from “a vanilla (one) and a chocolate (one)”, but “une chocolat” would sound really weird, because “chocolat” is a masculine noun. (“Une vanille” sounds fine.)

The “p” was aspirated. It just wasn’t aspirated *enough*.

The confusion in example 2 is at least understandable.  If the second syllable of "parapluie" is reduced enough, it sounds like "par lui" which means "by him."  So the person in the shop could have heard "I want to buy a by him."
But this sort of thing isn't specific to French; mispronouncing a word or using an unfamiliar word can impair communication, no matter what the language.  I can recall seeing programming...Read moreThe confusion in example 2 is at least understandable.

But this sort of thing isn’t specific to French; mispronouncing a word or using an unfamiliar word can impair communication, no matter what the language.  I can recall seeing programming questions on forums asking about “fixing a window” which drew confused responses of “is the window broken?”  The person meant “fix” in the sense of “keep it from moving, ” which is correct, but uncommon enough that other people didn’t get the meaning right away.

A few salient points:
• Some people, French or not, are douche-bags who intentionally pretend to not understand when others, particularly foreigners, say something that isn't perfect.
• The French have a reputation of being quite snooty.
• When it's clear that someone isn't a native speaker, a reasonable person will compensate by trying to pull an IE and decode the intended meaning anyway.

I’ve known people who had accents and encountered English speakers who couldn’t or wouldn’t understand what they said even though there was little to no difference from the correct pronunciation. I’m quite the spelling and grammar Nazi, but only to illiterate zoomers who think they can excuse their illiteracy with “it’s the Internet” or “language evolves” (yeah, tell that to your English teacher 🙄). That said, I always give leeway to non-native speakers, because, you know, I’m not a dick. ¬_¬

My anecdotal experience is very much the opposite.  As a beginner I had talked in completely broken sentences and even made up words by doing a Frenchy pronunciation of words in English, and very rarely did people have trouble understanding what I wanted to say.
Example 1 seems like a snobby woman who wanted to be a 4th grade teacher, not an actual problem with understanding.
Example 3 might be because they were trying to...Read moreMy anecdotal experience is very much the opposite.

Example 1 seems like a snobby woman who wanted to be a 4th grade teacher, not an actual problem with understanding.
Example 3 might be because they were trying to sound out the vowels “e”, “a”, “u” separately, which is a common mistake.  It should be similar to how you say the letter “O”, which should be just fine for Japanese speakers.  “L’eau” sounds like “low”.
Examples 2 and 4 might be a matter of not enunciating clearly.  I’ve had similar experiences trying to order “escargot” and “salade de fruits” and it turned out I was talking in a sheepish voice and they couldn’t hear me.

I second other commenters about the ice cream scenario (sentence seems fine).
Regarding the Academie Francaise, luckily it has more pretention than actual authority on the language. They make up words and rules which people happily disregard 😛
