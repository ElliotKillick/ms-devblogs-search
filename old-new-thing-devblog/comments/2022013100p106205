At least you can load two DLLs with the same name into the same process… back in 16-bit Windows, you couldn’t have two different modules with the same name. This really annoyed me when a font had chosen the module name I wanted…

Suppose the following three things happen in this order:
1. contoso_7ffe7d0e0000.dll is loaded
2. contoso.dll is loaded
3. A second contoso.dll is loaded at address 7ffe7d0e0000
What will the third module be named?

I don’t know. Why don’t you experiment and report back.

They get the same name.
Below, contoso_7ffe7d0e0000.dll was loaded first at 00007ffc`4dd60000, then contoso.dll at 00007ffc`2bcc0000, and finally the second contoso.dll at its fixed /BASE:"0x7ffe7d0e0000".
