Wait, I can use C++/WinRT with GCC?  Is GCC targeting mingw ABI-compatible with MSVC?

It only needs to be ABI-compatible with COM spec, which all relevant compilers can, possibly with some compiler-specific directives, if there is no virtual destructor nor multiple or virtual inheritance on the interface.
