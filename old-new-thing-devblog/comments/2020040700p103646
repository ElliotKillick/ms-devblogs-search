In the last example, the device watcher thread is waiting synchronously for the UI thread, but then the UI thread sends work back to the device watcher thread and waits synchronously for that to complete.  Isn't that a deadlock, or is the marshaling infrastructure magically able to execute callbacks in the device watcher's context while the thread is waiting in an InvokeInContext call?  Or is InvokeInContext not an inter-thread synchronous wait even in...Read moreIn the last example, the device watcher thread is waiting synchronously for the UI thread, but then the UI thread sends work back to the device watcher thread and waits synchronously for that to complete.
