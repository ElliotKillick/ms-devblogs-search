I must be missing something. Can the following not achieve the same thing?
namespace wrl = Microsoft::WRL;
struct MyFileSystemBindData :
    wrl::RuntimeClass<
        wrl::RuntimeClassFlags,
        IFileSystemBindData2,
        IFileSystemBindData
    >
{
    ⟦ implementation elided for expository purposes ⟧
}
The implementation of IFileSystemBindData2 covers IFileSystemBindData, since the former extends the latter.
If so, why do we need Chain­Interfaces?

I guess this is the modern version of QITABENTMULTI used with QISearch. That macro was error prone but the generated code is smaller than what templates give you.
