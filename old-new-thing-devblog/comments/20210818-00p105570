It’s ironic that Raymond of all people could misquote Bart Simpson given that he was responsible for originating and compiling episode capsules on alt.tv.simpsons for many years. I suppose it has been almost 30 years…

“Cowabunga, dude” is Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, not The Simpsons. Bart never said it.

I thought Bart Simpson was more “Don’t have a cow, man!”
Dude, for some reason, I associated more with Bill and Ted – “Party on ,dudes!”
