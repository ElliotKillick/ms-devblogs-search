“The IBM PC came with five expansion slots”
The IBM PC XT came with eight, and they changed the slot bracket to make the eight slots fit.

The original IBM PC only had five, the XT was a later model. You could in fact later buy an entire separate case (XT style case) with another 7 slots of expansion. Why 7 because one was required to bridge to the original IBM PC. This meant you’d have 11 total usable as one in the IBM PC would be taken up for the bridge. The case had its own PSU too.

I supported that card for a year when I was in the Hardware Group in Product Support. Microsoft also produced a card for the Apple II that had a z80 chip if I remember correctly.

Were a new AT clone really costing $4000 by 1988, especially with the rise of chipsets like the C&T NEAT?

There is a fourth copy. Somewhere in a dark closet I think I actually have an unopened review unit of OS/2 for the Mach 20, which I kept because I suspected it was the worst-seller in MS history. I also have an original IBM PC with a Mach 20 board installed, along with a Plus HardCard--20 MB! Many moons ago, I briefly resuscitated the HardCard with a hard whack to a wall (stiction?).

Somewhere in a dark closet I think I actually have an unopened review unit of OS/2 for the Mach 20, which I kept because I suspected it was the worst-seller in MS history. I also have an original IBM PC with a Mach 20 board installed, along with a Plus HardCard–20 MB! Many moons ago, I briefly resuscitated the HardCard with a hard whack to a wall (stiction?). Additional whacks were unsuccessful, so it no longer boots the system. But last I tried, a bootable floppy would do it–via the Mach 20’s floppy daughterboard.
In answer to Drew, the modem was outboard, 1200 or eventually 2400 bps, and generally attached via the RS-232 port that was more or less standard on multifunction memory cards. IBM’s official solution that nobody bought was a pricey RS-232-only card that wasted one of those precious five slots.
So the final five-slot roster in my original IBM PC was:
1. Mach 20 w/Disk Plus diskette interface
2. Hercules Monochrome Graphics Card
3. Plus 20 MB HardCard
4. Memory expansion card (AST SixPakPlus?) with RS-232 port and parallel port, and about 640K of RAM–and an all-important battery-run clock so you didn’t have to reset the time and date every time you booted up.
5. A mouse port? Maybe an internal modem that I used as a phone dialer with HotLine software? I will have to dig further into the closet, passing the PCjr and Tandy Model 100 (booted last I tried but has a Y2K problem) layers on my way.
BTW, I actually wrote about OS/2 for the Mach 20:

Didn’t seem to help sales much.

Hey, you gave it your best shot and that’s all we can hope for.  Amazing that you still have it after all these years!

I *STILL* have a Mach 20 board in an 8086 computer.  Still works to this day, though the ribbon cable is a little funky.  I have the memory add-on card, but *do not* have the floppy card.  Let me know if you want any pics for your blog article.

Reminds me of my favorite Microsoft product ever, the Z80 Softcard which let you run CP/M on your Apple ][.  I did my AP Computer Science course running CP/M Turbo Pascal running on these, worked great (MUCH better than Apple Pascal which was a virtual machine and slow as molasses).  Surprisingly (to me), Wikipedia says this was actually really popular and Microsoft’s top revenue source for 1980.

>  you haven’t even gotten to installing a network card
A what? My nets don’t need work. This is a computer. What about the modem, though?

I actually have an 8-bit ISA network card with a twisted pair ethernet transceiver that’s compatible with both my 8086 retro PC and my gigabit network switch.
There’s several decades of age difference on either end of that network cable, it’s impressive it works
