Even if there’s only one person working in the repo, it might be desirable to play the blame game, because one might want to know when a line has been last changed.

The above all makes sense. However, I am still left with the feeling that while you're right that it's a bad idea to use a global solution for a local problem, the broader issue is that git makes you jump through all these hoops (mentioned earlier this week) just to get it to accurately reflect the history of a file.

Sure, other source repository software may at times struggle with similar things, but I have had unusually frequent difficulty with git in this respect. It seems fundamentally broken in a number of ways, requiring extraordinary user hoop-jumping to get it to do things that are just run-of-the-mill operations in other environments.
On top of that, while not surprising at all, I find that this makes it a poster-child for the counter-argument to the claim that open-source is inherently better because it will enjoy broad community support to make it better. No, instead in practice there’s no economic incentive for git to get better, and no one has enough personal incentive to spend the significant amount of time it would take to fix git to handle these scenarios better. But, since it’s “free” it becomes the industry standard and everyone gets to live with its limitations, regardless, while commercially-available competitors can’t compete with “free” and so also can’t justify investing resources in improving themselves.
To be clear: I’m not against the fundamental idea of open-source. But it’s clear that its use should be approached much more carefully than it is.

Most "proprietary" version control systems simply can't keep line history in this situation at all - they don't even try.
So yes, git is objectively better - while imperfect, of course.
For example, the well-known proprietary centralised system currently used at my workplace needs multiple commands, with the output of each fed into complex powershell/bash/python etc scripts to give you the username and commit message that probably most recently changed a line.

For example, the well-known proprietary centralised system currently used at my workplace needs multiple commands, with the output of each fed into complex powershell/bash/python etc scripts to give you the username and commit message that probably most recently changed a line.
(And only a line. Not a range or a function)
Worse, it requires special incantations to rename a file – cannot detect rename, the user renaming/moving the file must explicitly say it’s a rename/move or it will be treated as a commit with a delete-file and unrelated create-file.
It has no way of dealing with a file split or join at all. The part that was split off or added to that filename simply vanishes or appears.
So it’s always Greg’s fault, no matter what.
Worst, its tracking across branches is strangely broken, often giving clearly wrong answers for no obvious reason. (Presumably if it were obvious then the vendor would have fixed it by now)
Which tends to make everything the fault of whoever accepts changes into the “master”/”release” branch. Sometimes.
I’m lead to believe that Mercurial is the only proprietary system that can do “XXX blame” properly, though I’ve never tried it myself.

Mercurial is actually open source as well (GPL 2+).

Humm… I think SVN also have “Copy” command that helps you copy file / folder and its history to another location within repository (or even as another branch)

I agree that it’s frustrating to have to jump through these hoops, but the point of these articles is not to complain about hoop-jumping, but rather to show that with the correct sequence of hoop-jumps, it is at least possible to get what you want with what you have today.
