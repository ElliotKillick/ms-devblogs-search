Some of the best javadoc WTFs I’ve seen are things obviously inheriting impossible things from their parents. As always, thanks for the cleanup; documentation is thankless but so invaluable to those of us who have to use it. (Though I consider this blog unofficial documentation of most of Win32 anyway.)

So this ends up being a lot like the BeOS is_computer_on function. I wonder if there’s an equivalent for is_computer_on_fire . . .
