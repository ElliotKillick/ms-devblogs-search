An error. In older English “thou” was the informal form, and “you” (or rather, “ye” from which “you” has evolved) was the formal.
Today most cases of thou appear to be formal, but that is 1. they’re old and the language was more formal, and 2. the bible. In the latter case remember the influence of the Reformation and having a personal relationship with God.

Need clarification.
I thought the English “Informal plural” form should be “them”, right? Or does “Informal plural” refer to something other than “pronoun you use to refer to multiple objects informally”?

The table is about second person direct address.

Y’all is the closest to a word in American English I can think of that qualifies as informal plural, but it’s a regional dialect and doesn’t apply across the language. Most people I know will say “you”, “guys”, “you guys”, or “everybody” when addressing a group of people, and none of it is strictly consistent.

Technically you have to capitalize Du and Ihr as well when they are used to address someone.

No this is rather a recommendation. You can also just always use lower-case “du”/”ihr”.

Being from Montreal (though a native English speaker), I grew up with "tu" (singular, informal) and "vous" (plural or formal).  You are more likely to hear "tu" in Quebec than you are in France.  Occasionally, feathers will get ruffled when Quebecois visiting France misjudge the formality of the situation.
But, I've lived in Texas for 20 years now.  I explain to folks from outside Texas that the rules here are similar to French:...Read moreBeing from Montreal (though a native English speaker), I grew up with “tu” (singular, informal) and “vous” (plural or formal).

Y’all is about the most informal, nails on a chalkboard, thing that could be used to refer to a group of people – at least here in Australia.
Ya is the informal you. Yous (you, pluralised) or yas (ya pluralised) is the super informal plural.  And both of them are best said when you happen to have a beer in hand and that’s it – in my very humble opinion of course!

And Russian still can’t decide if it is good with вы (non-capitalized) or Вы (capitalized) on formal occasions with undefined amount of persons. In a conversation with a single person it is a definite Вы, but if there are probably more… nobody knows.

As a German having lived in the US for five years, this got me wondering what I would use. It's true that in most situations where I meet Germans here I end up using "du". But is that maybe just because the situations where you meet a fellow German in the US are more likely to be that informal?
Would that train situation have occurred here in the US... I probably would still have used "Sie"....Read moreAs a German having lived in the US for five years, this got me wondering what I would use.

Would that train situation have occurred here in the US… I probably would still have used “Sie”. It’s very very subtle, there are of course no definitive rules, and it will vary from person to person. However, you were there with your family, and this creates some form of formality already. If you were sitting opposite of me in the train alone, wearing casual clothing, I would have used “du”. Casual clothing with family: “Sie”. Business attire, alone: Also “Sie”. Significantly older than me: “Sie”. Significantly older than me, but obviously on the way to a (rock or pop) concert or festival: “Du”. Significantly younger (adult) than me: Just slightly more likely to use “du”, still “Sie” if in business attire or with family for example. Anyone who I have previously met at any informal situation (someone’s birthday party, students at the same university at the same time even if we did not talk, friends of a mutual friend at the same Biergarten table): Overrides everything, it’s now “du”.
This is obviously me making situations up, in real situations other subtle details may shift it in either direction. Germans understand that it’s hard, and won’t fault you for anything.

As a German living in Germany I would second that behavior.
If I meet someone unknown to me I always use “Sie” except when the person is a teen or younger. Your last example with the festival is non-formal by default, so it’s “du”.
I was once talked at using “Sie” by a teenage girl standing in line at a McDonalds – that time I was 25 or so and I felt very old…
