Because their code doesn’t work when running as SYSTEM.

!!IsWellKnownSid(user->User.Sid, type)

I guess to convert from BOOL to bool (or from BOOLEAN or from DWORD or from int).

IsWellKnownSid is documented as returning either TRUE or FALSE, so seems pretty pointless to me.

The WinAPI BOOL is 4 bytes, the C++ bool is 1 byte (and strictly 0 or 1 these days, the WinAPI is often just 0 or != 0). Without !! (or != 0) the compiler is going to give you a warning.
