Seems like Bill (not G) and Ted usage. What do “bodacious” and “resplendent” mean in Microspeak, I wonder?

Bill & Raymond’s (not) Excellent Adventure (in mangling English)
Maybe they’re still trying to write the one program that unites the world in peace and harmony?

Funny, how “righteous” and “wicked” can both mean “excellent.”

I’m surprised that the second quote doesn’t say “a righteous ask”.

Asking a question is not an “ask”. An “ask” is when you want another team to do something for you. The more conventional word would be “request”.

Asking a question is not an “ask”.
Maybe the “ask” that’s captive inside Microsoft is clinging to its rustic roots, but when “ask” escaped into the wide corporate-speak world, it mutated into meaning any type of question.
