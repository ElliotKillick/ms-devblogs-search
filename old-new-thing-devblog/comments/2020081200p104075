Almost seems like c++ could use constraints on template type parameters similar to generics in C# but with ability specify things like static members and constructors with specific parameters. Interfaces as type constraints good in C# due to the way generics in .net work but templates in c++ would need something more flexible if it were to have constraints.

Then you’re going to like C++20: Constraints and concepts. https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/constraints Prior to C++20, you had to use SFINAE to constraint the template type parameters.

Microsoft may not have a time machine to fix task<T> to use std::variant, but shouldn’t continuations be passed const T & instead of T?
