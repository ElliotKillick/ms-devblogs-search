“If another user signs onto a Windows system without the previous user signing out, then the previous user goes into a state known as Disconnected”
According to this, on Windows Server, more than one user can be connected at any given time. Is that correct?

@Paul – Yes. While Desktop editions are limited to one active connection at a time, on Server editions, two users can be connected at the same time. And you can have more than two if you purchase Terminal Services CALs (Client Access Licenses).
