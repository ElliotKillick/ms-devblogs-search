Thank you for all your insights Raymond!  Years ago you had written about detecting the gamebar, How can I detect whether the Game Bar is covering my window?, which is something we needed!  It was suggested that C++/WinRT could greatly simplify this, but it is not clear how to utilize the tooling in this space.
