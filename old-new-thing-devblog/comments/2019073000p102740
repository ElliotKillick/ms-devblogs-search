Shouldn’t it be practical to do a better job with UWP/MSIX apps?

Windows Installer still has MsiUseFeature and MsiGetFeatureUsage. I suppose this tracking is not integrated with Programs and Features, then.
User Access Logging (UAL) is a newer scheme but I don’t think there is any documented way to correlate the arguments of UalRegisterProduct with subkeys of the Uninstall key.

If an app wanted to, could it still write this information? Or is this column purely legacy now, just to avoid crashing apps that seek this info?

Explorer always calculated it on the fly. There’s nowhere to “write” to override the calculation, or to force Explorer to report a specific value instead of returning nothing. (It’s not like there’s a registry key that generates code.)

I was thinking more along the lines of could an app have a line of code during its startup routine to write the current date to this field rather than Explorer calculate it.

Since the Uninstall key is in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, updating the field would require elevation.

Riiiight, forgot about that being in HKLM. That also explains our asset management tool listing all app usage as “unknown”. Seems like back in the day, the developers thought it would be handy to copy that information to the asset management tool. Now it’s just another blank column as well.

Well, there COULD be a “last time this app was used” key in a place that didn’t require elevation.  (It might have to store the last time *this user* used this app; I’m not sure what all keys are there for unelevated updating.)  And the Control Panel could consult this key to show the Last Used time.  But I doubt any of this is worth the effort.

Did it use the UserAssist key? The shell writes a entry there every time it launches something so one would think it would be reasonably accurate. Mapping from uninstaller to application is still a issue but a uninstall value could be added that points to the executable. MSI could do this automatically for things with just a single .exe.
