Despite doing Win32 programming since the mid 90s, I don’t think I’ve ever used SetProp before. Looks like it serves a similar function to GetWindowLong(Ptr) with GWL_USERDATA (and following values with appropriate WNDCLASS::cbWndExtra), albeit more flexible yet less efficient?

It’s primarily for the case where you want to attach data to a window that belongs to a class you didn’t write (so the GWL_USERDATA doesn’t belong to you), or to attach data in a generic way that another component can find (for example NonRudeHWND).

Hmm  So now  some properties are no longer cleaned up? Can that cause new/different problems? Could it not be possible to have a refrence count on the properties?

Not sure what you mean by “now some properties are no longer cleaned up.” Some very old versions of Windows may not have cleaned them up, but the cleanup has existed at least since Windows 3.1 (oldest version of Windows I have easy access to).
