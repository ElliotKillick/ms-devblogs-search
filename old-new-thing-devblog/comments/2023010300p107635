On the other hand, on closed platforms such as Xbox and (the late) Windows Mobile, if the end user can create, install, and execute a program even with only limited user privilege, the system is considered compromised.

And even in that case, this vulnerability report is bogus. The vulnerability would be how the rogue process got onto the system, not in what the rogue process can do once it’s there.

I’d be curious to know what the review process of these reports looks like. What percentage of reports are like this?

Yes, I’d love to know the same. Certainly it’s not news that there are “security researchers” out there who don’t have the slightest idea what they’re doing, nor that there are scoundrels who’ll spam crap reports in the hope of picking up some bounties. But I’d love to know what percentage is… what’s the signal/noise ratio for security reports?
