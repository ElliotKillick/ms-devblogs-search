One of my embedded systems classes this semester requires us to monitor switch pressing on a TI MSP430-series microcontroller.  The GPIO interrupts on the MCU can be configured as either rising edge- or falling edge-triggered, but not both.  I end up having to toggle the pin’s trigger direction each time the interrupt handler is invoked.

Yes – that’s how you do it in that MCU. But you’d best be served doing that in the timer ISR for the timer you set to do the debouncing of the switch. And you check that the I/O pin is still in the state you care about before changing the trigger settings of the I/O pin.
