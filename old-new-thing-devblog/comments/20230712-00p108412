A single call to GetMany is atomic. You will either get “all the elements as they were originally (prior to the removal)” or “all the elements after the modification (subsequent to the removal)”. As long as you slurp all the elements in a single GetMany call, you will get a coherent result. What you shouldn’t do is call GetMany to get some elements, and then GetMany again to get some more elements.

I cannot imagine a correct program that would require being notified about a concurrent modification. If the modification happens slightly later or earlier, it would not get detected, so such a notification is always a race.
