I read Int48 but I see 32 bit offsets (with some additional spacing on 64 bit)? I think at least something in the tables is off or needs more explanation.

That’s not Int48. It’s Int4B (letter B). Integer, four bytes. I have no idea why the type is named after its size in bytes rather than it size in bits.

This is the first time I see someone defer to something earlier. 😛
Or maybe it’s something written later but appear earlier on queue.

The English language is weird. There are multiple senses of “defer”. One is “to postpone”. Another is “to yield”.
