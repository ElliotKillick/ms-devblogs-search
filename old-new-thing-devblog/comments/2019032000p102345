I wrote something similar; an asynchronous fire and forget.
And I also don’t simply swallow and forget an exception, because I want it to be surfaced to so people can be aware of the bug and fix it.
But my mechanism of feedback to the developer is a bit different: i write an error  to the Windows event log.

And somehow this wasn’t a compatibility constraint?

C++/WinRT is a header-only library, so all the behavior changes are in the consumer, not the platform. If you don’t like the new behavior, don’t upgrade to it. Your code will continue to behave the way it did before.
