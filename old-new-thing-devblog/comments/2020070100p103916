> They all boil down to “Return from the function immediately, and resume execution when this asynchronous thing produces a value.”
Although one should clarify that if the expression to the right of the await keyword is a method (as in most cases), the method will be called and executes synchronously until it produces the Task, that is to be awaited on, before returning immediately (ignoring the synchronously completed fast path).

Extremely frustrating, but Win32 will live on.

If you’re a C# developer, then tasks cancel in the normal way, nothing new to learn. This is under-the-hood nonsense, which may help you understand how the pieces fit together, but not necessary to know how to use it. (And I think 7 years counts as old enough.)
