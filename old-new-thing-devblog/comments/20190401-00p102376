Untangling all computer cables?
That’ll last all of 15 seconds.

This sounds like high school dorm inspection…

“confirm this date is acceptable” was a tip-off.  It was well done.

Is the name “a-fday” imitating an existing Microsoft naming convention for something, e.g. a convention for email aliases?

“a-” means “agent/agency”. It’s the domain user name convention as well as the e-mail adddress (part before the domain).

That’s pretty amazing.  The only thing I can see on here that would possibly tip me off that it’s a prank is the last line: “Steam-cleaning carpets”.  There’s no way you’d want your employees handling that kind of task, especially ones like me that would just as likely ruin the carpet as they would clean them.

I’d think something is wrong when I see “a Microsoft Executive, a Microsoft VP” will inspect the building for a whole day.
There’s no way they’d assign irrelevent executive levels to spend a day to do such job, unless after some serious incident.

That reads enough like a real notification from RE&F that I’d believe it, even if I got it today. I’d wonder about the spelling in the ‘From’ address, but I’d probably chalk it up to a mistake.

According to the map, there’s a golf course across the street.  Everyone should just go over there for a few hours while waiting for the “inspection” to finish.

How many people panicked at this notice before noticing this?
That’s not a bad prank.
