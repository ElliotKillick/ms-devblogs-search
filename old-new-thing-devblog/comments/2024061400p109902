In the Acquire method, I think that the previous should be initialized inside the loop ?

m_state.compare_exchange_weak(previous, state) atomically does
if (m_state == previous)
{
    m_state = state;
    return true;
}
else
{
    previous = m_state; // no need for additional load
    return false;
}

Make sure the compiler isn’t adding locks to your lock-free algorithm behind your back:
static_assert(std::atomic<State>::is_always_lock_free);
Godbolt tells me that most x64 compilers can handle that, but not all, most x86 ones can’t, and most x64 compilers can’t handle any larger state than that.
