Isn’t the point of autocomplete to display something on the screen? And to display anything on the screen, you need to execute code on the UI thread, so I don’t think there’s any problem with going back to the UI thread to do the last bit of work.

Indeed, which thread is the Edit control firing its TextChanged events on in the first place?

Since it’s a UI control, it stands to reason that the event is raised on the UI thread.

I think Neil Rashbrook was asking a rhetoric question. I’m quite a non-expert on thread exiting, but the UI thread could have ended before autocomplete is computed?

Oh, I got my articles confused. This one is on the assumption that the EditControl does not have UI affinity. (Pretend “EditControl” is really some non-UI thing.)
