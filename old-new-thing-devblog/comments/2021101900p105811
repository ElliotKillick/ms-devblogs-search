in the linked article, a missed opportunity….
“We are the first cloud provider that is running two-phase immersion cooling in a production environment,” said Husam Alissa,
Why did he not say, “We are the first cloud provider that is actually making it rain in a production environment,”??

I want to know what that fluid is. I’ve heard of immersing the computer in liquid nitrogen before, but this is not that.

The article says 3M but the reality is it’s almost certainly Fluorinert unless they wanted to do something super special. But it could also be “Novec Engineered Fluids”. Not sure how much people still use that as they are ‘low-toxicity’ not… non-toxic.

It would likely be Novec. It used to be Fluorinert, but since it is so stable, it does not break down in the environment, and as a result has a huge global warming potential, and that requires special handling and disposal. Novec is a new chemistry that degrades much more rapidly outdoors.
