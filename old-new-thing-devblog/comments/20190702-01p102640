A good friend of mine is from New Zealand.  He told me about Silly Leg and Dibbly-Dobbly.  "You can field in the slips, at gully, at square leg or even at silly point" is from http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/rules_and_equipment/4179600.stm, although the chart doesn't show the silly point.

Yes, pretty good summary, I'd wouldn't do nearly so well at any US sport.  The phrase "The fielding side may place its players pretty much anywhere they choose." made me smile as it brings to mind that there are certain rules about where fielders can be placed.  These rules came about because of the Bodyline series where (in part) the placement of fielders caused a diplomatic incident between England and Australia.

Not a bad description! The main thing I'd add, for people coming to it for the World Cup specifically, is that the rule changes to make a shorter game (from 5 days down to 1) also impose pretty heavy restrictions on exactly where fielders can stand (although you're correct that it's "pretty much anywhere" in the 5-day version of the game). 
For example: a maximum number of people can field "outside the circle" (the circle...Read moreNot a bad description!

For example: a maximum number of people can field “outside the circle” (the circle being the inner area within 30 yards of the pitch), and this maximum changes at various points in the game, and there are also rules that you have to have at least 3 people fielding on either side of the batsman. These rules are there to favour the batting team, encouraging them to play more exciting shots.

Excellent explanation of the rules Raymond! I do hope you keep the series going – I’d love to read about American Football.
I’d maybe throw the term Innings into this one on Cricket
“After each side gets two turns (innings) in the field and two turns (innings) at bat”

Pretty good interpretation! Look forward to the (even longer?) post explaining the field positions/terminology in the game. Only the English would have come up with anything like this (a sample: long on, mid-off, cow corner, point, 3rd man, and of course, the "silly" positions).
I prefer this, much simpler explanation of the game:
You have two sides, one out in the field and one in. Each man that's in the side that's in goes out,...Read morePretty good interpretation!

I prefer this, much simpler explanation of the game:
You have two sides, one out in the field and one in. Each man that’s in the side that’s in goes out, and when he’s out he comes in and the next man goes in until he’s out. When they are all out, the side that’s out comes in and the side thats been in goes out and tries to get those coming in, out. Sometimes you get men still in and not out.
When a man goes out to go in, the men who are out try to get him out, and when he is out he goes in and the next man in goes out and goes in. There are two men called umpires who stay all out all the time and they decide when the men who are in are out. When both sides have been in and all the men have been out, and both sides have been out twice after all the men have been in, including those who are not out, that is the end of the game!

You think that explanation is simple?  My head exploded.  🙂
