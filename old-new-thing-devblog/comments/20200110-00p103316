As I always say: “Timers are the developer’s duck tape”

Heh, I always assumed TrackMouseEvent was implemented internally using a timer.

(The atom feeds seems to be broken again. But hey, it at least it made it to this decade… looks like the RSS feed last updated on New Year’s Eve…)
Edit: Fixed again, thanks!

Oh no, it’s too late to suggest a ‘British Monarchy Succession” tree-traversal article 🙁

I think that’s the same as preorder, isn’t it?

I think there is a post-traversal removal of any nodes that are Roman Catholic 🙂 It would have been more complicated before the removal of male-preference primogeniture in 2015

How do you evaluate the gender of a tree node?

Same way you distinguish a mail plane 🙂

Maybe the tooltip control can offer optimization that as soon as it see a WM_MOUSELEAVE message got forwarded, it can silently disable the timer it created.
So even if the control isn’t subclassed, you can avoid burning user battery after (maybe) a few minutes. (And add a new tips in category of “weird Windows workaround with good reason”.)

CCM_SETVERSION could be used to allow different behavior for new comctl32 versions, that is why this message exists. Comctl v6 was also a new opportunity to change behaviors.

“Hey, I think four years ago, there was this thing we wanted to do but couldn’t. Do you remember what that was?” (This assumes that there’s even a person from the old team that is still on the new team.)

Shouldn’t it have been documented in a bug database somewhere?

Ah, that would be the problem. I had assumed the old bug databases had been migrated. I suppose that doesn’t really make sense given that Windows 98 is a completely different architecture, but I hadn’t thought about it that way.

I’m not saying scroll through the whole thing; that is obviously a bad plan. It’s a database. Filter on status (open or on hold or wontfix-compatibility or whatever) and component (comctl32) and you’d have a to-do list of things to consider for v6. Maybe I don’t understand the quirks of the system in question but it seems like you should be able to do something along those lines.

That's still a lot of bugs to have to read through to see if any of them have a comment of the form "In the future, we might choose to..." And the bugs might be in databases that have been retired, so you will never find them. In this case, the "In the future, we might choose to..." would be a comment in the Windows 98 bug database, but comctl32 v6 didn't arrive until Windows...Read moreThat’s still a lot of bugs to have to read through to see if any of them have a comment of the form “In the future, we might choose to…” And the bugs might be in databases that have been retired, so you will never find them. In this case, the “In the future, we might choose to…” would be a comment in the Windows 98 bug database, but comctl32 v6 didn’t arrive until Windows XP. By then, the Windows 98 bug database was long gone. (And in practice, not everybody is so diligent to make such a comment when closing out a bug.)
