I don’t know the optimal design pattern for extending an interface, so I assume these interfaces have been created as independent interfaces and don’t inherit from each other, otherwise I was wondering whether it would have been possible to change the default interface depending on the minimum Windows version.

You can’t change the default interface, because that would break interop between old and new components. The old component passes IMyClass to represent a MyClass, but the new component thinks it got a IMyClass2, calls method 5 on the vtable, and calls the wrong method.

As an alternate solution, is there a serious problem with just trying to access the member and catching the exception?

You won’t know if the exception was because SomeMember is missing (possibly recoverable, operation never started), or because SomeMember itself threw an exception (probably not recoverable, operation may have partly completed, leaving myObject in indeterminate state). Also because many debuggers stop on first-chance exceptions (before they are caught).

That’s why in 2 or 3 years ago, removing an attribute that is DOM property can also remove the underlying DOM property.
