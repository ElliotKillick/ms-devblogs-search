A layperson’s multi-step solution: Let the final result be commit `final`. Rewind to `origin/master` and merge with `topic` without resolving any conflict. Load the final result and amend the merge commit.

Stockholm syndrome I gather.
I don’t even want to think about trying to do something like this in CVS.

I find the git-reparent script (https://github.com/MarkLodato/git-reparent) useful for making such changes.
git reparent -p M2 -p F2

For completeness, if you didn’t take the time to write out all the relevant commit IDs before rebasing:
* M2 was not affected by the rebase, so it is still the head of master.
* F2 is the historically previous head of the feature branch, designated as feature@{1}.
