Isn’t it possible to just write if (usage.ConnectionDuration() > 0s) in C++?

It’s possible, but it’s not the same thing. Though now I realized that I could have written auto seconds = usage.ConnectionDuration() / 1s;

Or you could have written if (usage.ConnectionDuration() >= 1s) if the absolute identical behavior must be preserved.

In C# `GetNetworkUsageAsync` takes `DateTimeOffset`.  If you subtract one day from a `DateTime`, and there’s a DST boundary, the difference will not be 24 hours (and the resulting time may not exist, although the implicit conversion won’t throw an error).
