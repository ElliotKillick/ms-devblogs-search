One reason to support DIFF and SYLK is because i want to be a good developer and pay my programmer taxes.
If i'm trying to make data available to other applications through an `IDataObject`, and i already support:
- HTML
- Text
- Unicode Text
- PNG
- Bitmap handle
If it's trival enough for me to include other formats that might help out another application: i'd like to do that:
- CSV
- Diff
- Sylk
- FileDescriptorRead moreOne reason to support DIFF and SYLK is because i want to be a good developer and pay my programmer taxes.

I used to like DIF files. I was a bit sad when CSV files displaced them as the lowest common denominator for this sort of data interchange.

Amusingly
a) Sylk is also the brand name of a product you may not want to search for
b) within living memory (well into the 2010s though not in Office 365 ProPlus which is what I’m using) having a CSV file (with the CSV suffix) beginning ID, in the first line would give you a weird message about SYLK files.

Again, not the clipboard format, but for a project at a company that I used to work for, we needed to be able to generate a file that would automatically open in Excel for the user. As I recall, CSV wasn’t quite automatic enough to keep the user happy, so we ended up creating the file in (I think) SYLK format.

Both are documented in this not-so-long list of standard clipboard formats: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dataxchg/standard-clipboard-formats
Emphasis on “documented” and “standard”.
Both have the least description among others. Looks like the customer was going through this list while implementing clipboard support and had a valid request of giving more information on the parts that are not well described, but worded it poorly.

What sort of additional description would have helped the customer? Should the documentation say something like “This format is obsolete”? Who’s to say that it’s obsolete? Windows itself never used the format, but some spreadsheet programs still do (probably only reluctantly).

How about something like "Data Interchange Format, a spreadsheet format introduced by Software Arts' VisiCalc"?  Key words being "spreadsheet" and "VisiCalc" (probably a more recognizable name than "Software Arts").
I'd then expect developers browsing the list to have one of three reactions:
1. My program has nothing to do with spreadsheets, so I'll ignore it.
2. VisiCalc?  Now, there's a name I haven't heard in years!  Surely nobody uses that format anymore.

3. Well, I am working with spreadsheets.  Is this “DIF” a format I need to support?  Is it compatible with Excel?
And if the customer happened to fall into category #1 or #2, they wouldn’t bother asking you about it.

Not sure about the specific customer, I'm just giving the benefit of a doubt here.
The main issue, I believe, is that a vendor/application specific format has a constant value in the documentation instead of being in an application-specific range (CF_PRIVATEFIRST...CF_PRIVATELAST ?), so it must be important or a special case, right? Adding that it's a spreadsheet could help.

Adding that it’s a spreadsheet could help. When implementing clipboard support you want to cover all relevant formats: I want the user to be able to paste images into my application. Let’s see… CF_BITMAP probably, CF_DIB could be, CF_DIBV5 it’s a bitmap so yes I guess, CF_DIF what’s that? Data Interchange Format, but what data? Text data? Pixels? Sound? I’ll better ask Microsoft for clarification just to be sure.

Trawling the documentation for clipboard data formats to support seems like a bad idea.  The clipboard formats to support should follow from the purpose of the app.  If it's to work with audio files, then you'd probably want to support CF_WAVE, maybe CF_RIFF, and anything you want pass along in the CF_PRIVATE range.  If support for the DIF and SYLK format didn't arise from the development of the program (or from it's...Read moreTrawling the documentation for clipboard data formats to support seems like a bad idea.

Doing a bit of searching generally solves the problem for me: Wikipedia has a fairly comprehensive article on both DIF and SYLK where it’s pretty clear what the formats are. There are cases where the search results are ambiguous or non-existent, but I’d probably check on Stack Exchange or similar before spending one of my limited Microsoft support incidents.

Or maybe it’s an issue of poor naming and poor documentation rather than silly customers doing things backwards.
“Data Interchange Format” and “Symbolic Link format” sound pretty useful when it comes to clipboard operations. I don’t know that I’d have identified them as decades dead spreadsheet formats either…

In less malicious news, I also heard about DIF being used to this day as a trivially generable format, still readable by pretty much every spreadsheet software out there.

I suppose it’s possible the client wondered what their program ought to do if it was asked to paste from the clipboard and encountered data in one of those formats.

If the program encounters data in these formats and neither it nor the programmers know anything about these formats, then the program should do nothing.  That's what I would expect of well-written programs when they encounter data in a format that they don't understand.  Better that than copy/interpreting/parsing/mangling data in an unknown format.  things go quickly from bad to worse once you start down that road.

On the other hand, if the program genuinely needs to copy data from the clipboard in those formats, then study up on those formats and write the program to properly handle them.
As stated, the customer’s question wants data about the formats and then decide if they need to implement code to handle these formats.  “Let me drink from the firehose of info and figure it out for myself”.  That may be fine for the programmer but it’s not good for the person who responds to such a request, for the reasons that Raymond stated.  I’ve been the person to respond to such requests (though not for Microsoft) and the time spent gathering the info is much better spent elsewhere.
