removing a code between Vista and 7 seems like exactly the sort of situation that would demand a version change because a string may not be compatible with a newer windows version. Guessing someone decided that code changes don’t need a version change maybe they are being reserved for a more fundamental change of syntax but even then they changed in 7 too.
