For an example of the authority/subauthority model gone wild, look at SNMP OIDs. The OID for the fan status table for an HP ProLiant server, for example, might be 1.3.6.1.4.1.232.6.2.6.4. Everything up to the 232 is a division of authority (232 is Compaq, who originated the ProLiant series before HP acquired them.)

The thing that I noticed, which did help somewhat, is that Windows does cache capabilities that it knows. Some SIDs do not resolve into friendly names gave me a hint for figuring this out. This is undocumented, unsupported and incomplete, but it has given me a way to map capability names to SIDs for the most common capabilities.
