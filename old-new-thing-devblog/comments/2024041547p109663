I hadn’t seen the Egghead story before.  Neat and familiar.
Back in the day I was working on Win 95 drivers for the Gravis Ultrasound. We didn’t buy every game, but we did buy everything that made PC Gamer’s top 100 Games list.

I was an alpha tester of Windows 92 XX 93 XX 94 XX 95. I filed quite a few bugs on it. One was quite serious, it killed my software when they tried to extend the Window Handles addressing. Broke every piece of Win16 software in sight.

Have you seen the video by “MattKC” about modifying .NET to work on Windows 95? It seems like a lot of that would be relevant to your previous work.
