Does Windows Update Cleanup keep track of uncompressed system binaries that it already tried to use WofShouldCompressBinaries on, or will Windows Update Cleanup keep trying to recompress the same binaries each time itâ€™s run?

We exceeded the hour run on a Server 2008 R2 box. The ability to garbage collect components superceded by hotfixes had finally been backported and the first run took two hours.

Well dang, I was running the cleanup tool manually because I knew it uses quite some CPU and wanted it to get it over with on my schedule rather than random system schedule. Guess I should stop doing that.

Well, if you can allocate some time slot that youâ€™ll not be using your machine, itâ€™s good idea to assign these CPU consuming task at that time so itâ€™ll not get into your way when you are using it.
