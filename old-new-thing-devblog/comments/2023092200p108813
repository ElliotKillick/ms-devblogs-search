I don’t know what’s worse, that I understood the problem, or that I have a way on file to compile executables so this works *anyway*.

My issue here is that any potential solution to this that I can think of would never top the simplicity of having the rundll32 type layout. This would give you the best of both worlds. The only downside would be that you would need to distribute two files instead of one.

The last part of goading the customer is a nice addition to your “psychic debugging” techniques which I’ve used to great success. Thanks!
P..S. Another one: when presented with a screen dump/error dialog box: study the surrounding graphics, especially the X close box, this helps you determine if it’s Windows 7,8,10 or 11.
