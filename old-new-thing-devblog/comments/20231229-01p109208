Speaking of links, the redirect for older URLs to this blog is broken so all links to blogposts that are more than few years old lead to 403.
e.g. http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/05/13/10417964.aspx redirects to https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/10417964.aspx instead of https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20130513-00/?p=4393 and the links inside article are similarly broken.
Posting this here in the hopes you can forward this to someone in charge of blog software as all the contact links from "Suggestion Box" articles are dead now.

Looks like some type of record file format header footer thing. Wouldn‚Äôt a program language demand more explicit closing braces?

Hello Raymond, could you please make a post on Dark Mode in Win32 apps? The official documentation (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/apply-windows-themes) omits many things, for example, how to make dialog boxes and standard controls support the dark mode. As the result, if you google for "win32 dark mode", you will find a lot of buggy implementations relying on undocumented APIs, which work differently in different Windows versions. You have a fantastic expertise in Win32 API, so it would...Read moreHello Raymond, could you please make a post on Dark Mode in Win32 apps?
