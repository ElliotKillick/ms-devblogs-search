There’s a better technique (by STL, popularised by Scott Meyers):
template<typename...>
class TD; // TD == "Type Displayer"
...
TD<T> Type;
The advantage is that you don’t have to wait for the linking phase – the compiler will complain straight away.

I prefer to wait until the linking stage, because that lets me see two things at once: Whether the code would have compiled, and what the type is. I use this technique mostly on gcc.godbolt.com.

I thought you were not allowed to mention anything non-Microsoft by mentioning brand names in this blog.

Holding my breath for someone to implement a meta-debugger for template metaprogramming, using template metaprogramming.

This is the most profound blog entry you have ever written. I have bookmarked it. I think you have just taught me everything that I need to know about this metaprogramming thing. I might use this for inspiration in a future version of our product.

The other day, I decided to resurrect MS InfoViewer as a (Django?) web site, complete with “Dr. GUI’s Espresso Stand” and everything. I’ll include your blog somehow — i.e., via scraping — if you don’t mind. It may take me a few years to write, as it will be be powered by the actual MFC app image running in a x86 emulator underneath, with the actual October 1996 MSDN CD-ROM images. Naturally, there will be CSS style sheets for that retro Windows look. What do you think? Will the lawyers come after me? Well, maybe I’ll just run it on my intranet. I just can’t stand MSDN nowadays. I don’t think they even call it that anymore. (Why do they break out the A/W versions of Win32 API functions separately nowadays, anyways?)

It might be handy to include a link to an MSVC demangler (like http://demangler.com/) so that folks can demangle `??$whatis@AEAN@@YAXXZ` into a more readable type `void __cdecl whatis<double & __ptr64>(void)`

The compiler undecorates it for you in the comment, as I noted. If you really want to undecorate it yourself, you can use the undname program that comes with Visual Studio.
