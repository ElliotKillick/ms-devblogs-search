Guessing confusion came from documentation not being clear enough that fire_and_forget is actually a type

Or if you really want to run this asynchronously, use
co_await winrt::resume_background();

Or rather double check whether DoFirstThing and DoSecondThing are async APIs and remember to co_await their return values…  (although it’s generally good practice to co_await resume_background() first anyways)
