If you go to Tankfest at the Tank Museum in Bovington you get an annual membership as part of the cost of the festival ticket, iirc. I think a lot of museums here like to encourage you to come back more often so you spend more money at the shops, which is probably where they make most of their money.

It seems as though quite a few UK attractions only offer an annual membership. This seems odd at first, but many museums don‚Äôt really anticipate that you will come back regularly, so I think it‚Äôs a way to entice you to do so (and spend money anyway in the shop, cafe, etc.). IIRC, Bletchley Park gave annual memberships instead of day-tickets.

It's for tax relief reasons. Charities can claim tax back on donations via the Gift Aid scheme. Some time ago, this was extended to charitable 'donations' in return for admission to an attraction or museum. But there are caveats for this to be allowed: either an additional donation has to be made (so there is a higher admission fee), or the charity has to give an annual membership.

Our local theme parks offer annual passes, but only to those kicking within the state (Queensland, Australia)
Their thinking, I believe, is to make it an easy weekend thing to do so you go several times per year. The food & drink prices are extortionate so that's their big money spinner.
They used to police what you could bring in, but last I went (probably 5 years ago now) they didn't bother looking. It also...Read moreOur local theme parks offer annual passes, but only to those kicking within the state (Queensland, Australia)

It‚Äôs not just about spending money in the cafe and gift shop, there is also the ‚ÄúI must take you to this cool place I found‚Äù factor. If I‚Äôd already got free admission then I‚Äôm more likely to drag someone along. In fact they ought to pay me commission.
