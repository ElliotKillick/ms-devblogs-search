I love seeing the C translations of COM components!

I tried to learn COM back in the late 90’s when I had only a year of C++ under my belt, and it was nothing but confusing. I read the COM specifications and it didn’t help much. I got the Don Box book and it helped some (especially the introductory parts on why COM was developed) but I still couldn’t wrap my head around it. I found the “helper” macros especially confusing (even when using MFC) because they seemed written for people who were already COM experts.
I had almost a decade of C programming experience, so I tried programming COM in C without using the macros.  It was amazing how much easier it was to understand COM once the C++ integration and helper macros were removed.
I’m excited to see where this series goes!

It looks like the hidden ‘This’ parameter didn’t get expanded for Method3 and Method4…
I think the code should look like this:
/* STDMETHOD(Method3)(THIS_ int iParameter) PURE; */
HRESULT (__stdcall* Method3)(ISample2 *This, int iParameter);

/* STDMETHOD_(int, Method4)(THIS_ int iParameter) PURE; */
int (__stdcall* Method4)(ISample2 *This, int iParameter);
