A few errors.
1. slim_event::signal should set signaled = true, presumably before the atomic_thread_fence.
2. The lambda in await_suspend should use tracked_slim_event rather than slim_event_tracker, which is not defined.
3. The handle() statement in the lambda should end with a semicolon.
4. finder->value.signal() should be just finder->signal().
