I would get on the California line at Market near Embarcadero, not the line at Union and Powellâ€¦ and change somewhere to (I think) the Powell-Hyde line, and go to Ghiradelli Square!

using the MuniMobile App was exactly what I did when visiting SF in last year. the main advantage is not only the price, but you donâ€™t have to wait for for hours at the ticket booth and the endpoint to get into the cable car. with the app ticket simply take the next hop on station and you are in!

Another tip is if youâ€™re planning on riding just the non-cable-car vehicles for a day, get a day pass in the Muni app. (That is the only way to get a day pass, unfortunately). Otherwise, youâ€™ll be paying $2.50 or $3 every two hours.

Editing oopsie?  Footnote 2 doesnâ€™t appear to have a reference in the post.

Damn, thanks, I wish I knew this when I last went as I wasted quite a bit on cable car fares!
