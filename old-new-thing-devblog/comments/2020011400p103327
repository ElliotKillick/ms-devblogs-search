The “Bill Gates’s secretary kept it on speed dial” link seems to be non-functional. It says “This request was blocked by the security rules”. Same for web archive.

I think that’s probably a local problem for you and your IT policy.

I told the owner of that burger master this about 20 or so years ago. He had never heard it before. I love that place and miss it now that I live far away in Texas. I make sure to go to burger master anytime I’m back in the area.

Once upon a time, I have a colleague that call and buy the same set of set lunch everyday from the canteen on ground floor (except on leave, of course).
Listen him dial the number then say 「照舊吖, 唔該」(roughly translates to “Just as usual, thank you.”) then cut the call, without saying what he order and what the address to send the meal to always amuse me.

We can basically do that with our regular Chinese restaurant; they recognise everyone in our family’s voice (we’ve been going there for over 30 years). Even when we go through the whole order they can tell us when we’ve forgotten something.

They still knew the address… it turns out the owner knew my voice well enough. Probably a sign I eat too much of their food!

Probably not. I think the cashier (who take note of phone orders there) recognized his voice since he ordered food there almost everyday at roughly the same time.

Interesting, I would have guessed the name was a corruption of the German word Bürgermeister (mayor, or literally “master of the citizens”).  The name seems to fit the role of the segment nicely.
