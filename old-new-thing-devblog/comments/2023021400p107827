Was Microsoft the first one to do this? Seems so bog standard these days, ar least on Android devices. I don’t know about Apple products.

First one to do what, you mean?
Eg. Android uses power + volume down for screenshot, and Microsoft never did that, so here they are still last?

– Bug report: Second table says: Power+VolumeUp
– Android also seems to use Power+VolumeDown. Coincidence? I think not?
