I had difficulty finding operator co_await(std::chrono::duration). C++/WinRT apparently defines it as winrt::operator co_await(winrt::Windows::Foundation::TimeSpan), where winrt::Windows::Foundation::TimeSpan is the same as std::chrono::duration, and there are conversions to this type from other types of durations.
The other operator co_await functions in C++/WinRT are in namespace winrt::Windows::Foundation, like their parameters (such as IAsyncAction), so they can be found with argument-dependent lookup.
