should there also be a to_u16string? and versions that take a u8string_view?

I suppose I get why the wstrings are named like that (string for wide characters) but I’m not sure what to think of hstring (high characters??). You explained a while ago that the H in HRESULT likely means ‘handle’, but I’m not sure that makes sense here.. Any clues? 🙂

Yeah, I’m pretty sure it’s a “handle” to a string, in some logical sense.

The documentation says that winrt::hstring encapsulates HSTRING, and that HSTRING is a handle to a Windows Runtime string, so I think your guess is correct.  The documentation for HSTRING adds “use HSTRING to represent immutable strings in the Windows Runtime” and there are various associate API functions, e.g., WindowsCreateString and WindowsDeleteString.
