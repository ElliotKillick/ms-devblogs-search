I think there were also some cases of variadic functions being marked as stdcall in the headers (possibly by just sticking on WINAPI or whatever macro in the funtion signature like everything else had). A search seems to confirm this memory, and the compiler just ignored the convention specifier.

The RichEdit team took it to the next level when they implemented ITextServices and related "COM" interfaces. They just declared a C++ class inheriting from IUnknown in their header. This means the first 3 methods are normal COM stdcall and the rest are MSVC thiscall. Passing a parameter in ECX when coding in C is rather difficult.
At least one other component did the same mistake but I can't remember off the top of my head,...Read moreThe RichEdit team took it to the next level when they implemented ITextServices and related “COM” interfaces.
