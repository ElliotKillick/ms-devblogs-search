Actually, wouldn’t it be great if event sources just accepted handlers that returned IAsyncOperation<> instead of void.  That way, the source could naturally track when the handler logically has completed, and could  naturally get what it wants the handler to compute for it, without using deferrals or response properties.  The handler would do both simply with a co_return.

Can the goal be achieved by synchronously waiting for an async lambda?

deviceWatcher.Added([lifetime = get_strong(), this](const auto &&, auto &&e) {
  [this, &e]() -> IAsyncAction {
    co_await Dispatcher();
    viewModel.Append(DeviceItem{e});
  }().get();
});
