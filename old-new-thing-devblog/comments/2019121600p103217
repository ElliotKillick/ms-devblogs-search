I think there are two bugs in resume_in_any_apartment:
1. If the status is AsyncStatus::Started, then await_ready() returns true, but should return false.
2. The awaiter{ {}, std::move(async) } construction should omit the empty {} because struct awaiter has no base classes and only one data member.

Correct on both counts. Thanks.
