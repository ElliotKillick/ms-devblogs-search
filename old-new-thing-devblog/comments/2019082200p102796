more than 64KB of code.. I could imagine it happenening with some pathological case of loop unrolling otherwise i pity whoever would need to maintain a function big enough to have that problem.

I once hit the limit on bytecode in a JVM method (32766 bytes I think; 2^15 minus a couple). It was in auto-generated code for startElement() in a SAX handler for an XML format with over 1000 declared XML elements (a sensible XML format for the domain), and it was mostly a huge if-else chain with string comparisons on the elementâ€™s namespace and name. I broke the method up a bit. (The class still has hundreds of fields.)
