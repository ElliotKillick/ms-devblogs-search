Why did Windows 95 flush the instruction cache for every function call? That must be a big performance killer.

I think he probably meant calling a function invalidates the prefetch queue. This would force the processor to reload any pre-loaded instructions that may have been modified.

The people you need to ask that are at Intel. As Raymond said in the linked article, it wasn’t Windows manually doing the flushing, but the Pentium processor, automatically.
