Oh, very similar to one I got two weeks ago offering me help to secure an internship at a leading technology company. The very one I already work for! And they knew that of course because they used my work email with that company’s name in the address.

This could make sense if their analysis included how many broken links to pages on microsoft.com there are on the rest of the web.

To be fair, they did offer to help improve the site’s usability and it certainly can not be argued that Microsoft’s website has very good UI/UX. ¬_¬

I thought this was pretty funny but decided to test it and maybe these guys were right lol.
My search terms on google were “operating system for pc” and “best operating system”.
Microsoft didn’t show up on the first page for the first one and was really low for the latter.
On bing the results were the same. In fact bing recommends a bunch of linux distros.
Maybe take these guys up on there offer!

Search engines are slowly but steadily being overcome by content farms. Quite often in the first 10 results, 8 or 9 go to such pages. You can recognize them easily because of the sheer amount of advertisements, and the tacky generic looking text.

Agreed. I searched “best operating system for pc” on Bing and microsoft.com is not within the first 25 pages of results!
