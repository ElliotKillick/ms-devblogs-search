Isn’t that exactly what you’re supposed to check with TestCooperativeLevel?
It returns D3DERR_DEVICELOST when your device was lost, you keep checking (in a relaxed loop), and once you get D3DERR_DEVICENOTRESET, you reset your device and off you go.

It appears that’s exactly what the customer didn’t want to do… or was calling “Plan B”. Here is the relevant excerpt:

Good thing then that neither of those two OSes are still supported. Windows 95 also wouldn’t work.

Still have a PC running Windows 98 – links my MIDI keyboards and controllers. Boots faster than my Windows 10 laptop…
