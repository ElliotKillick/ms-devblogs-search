Oh my, this “line” leaves me very cold:
auto consentResult = co_await wil::capture_interop< 
        winrt::IAsyncOperation,      
        winrt::UserConsentVerifier>(                    
        &::IUserConsentVerifierInterop::                
            RequestVerificationForWindowAsync,          
            hwnd,                                       
            WRL::Wrappers::HStringReference(            
                L"Just checking that it's you.").Get());
Admittedly I still code the MFC way, but this just seems like code that can only be written by looking up an example in the docs and Copy & Pasting.
