Isn’t this a global solution to a local problem?  This looks like an ODR violation waiting to happen.

Fortunately, this is a global solution to a global problem. The fact that IFileSystemBindData2 derives from IFileSystemBindData2 is not a per-file opinion. And is_guid_of is specializable for exactly this purpose.

This may be a global solution to a global problem. I’m not convinced, though, that there is strictly a single possible implementation to any given solution. As such, this is indeed an ODR violation waiting to happen.

IMO however it would be more pleasant if implements automatically detected interface inheritance so that implements<IFileSystemBindData2> would also implement IFileSystemBindData and handle QI for both interfaces correctly…

I am a bit surprised… Recalling https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20200324-00/?p=103586#comment-136437 then the answer is that ILauncherOptions3 was never a descendant of ILauncherOptions?
