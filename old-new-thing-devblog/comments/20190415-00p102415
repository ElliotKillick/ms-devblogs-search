As someone with practically no knowledge about U.S. taxes, I wonder how the extension is automatic when you have to apply for it.

It is automatically approved, provided you meet the criteria.

You also have to pay your estimated taxes (if you owe) at the time you file for the automatic extension. So you have to have already completed your taxes to file for an extension to complete your taxes or risk interest and penalties if you find out later you owe but did not pay on 15 April.

Right, it’s an “Extension of time to file, not an extension of time to pay”.  I think you are charged interest on any additional money owed when you finally do file at the extended deadline.
