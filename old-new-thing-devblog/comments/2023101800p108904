Is this guaranteed? As in, documented? A link to documentation would be nice.

The CreateDispatcherQueueController function also states:
“If options.threadType is DQTYPE_THREAD_CURRENT, then a DispatcherQueue is created and associated with the current thread. An error results if there is already a DispatcherQueue associated with the current thread.”
So I would call that documented. I didn’t include to the link to the learn page here, since that makes the post go under review, but it is easy enough to find by searching for the function name.

It’s implied by the function signature: GetForCurrentThread returns a single DispatcherQueue. If a thread could have more than one DispatcherQueue, then the function signature would return a collection.
