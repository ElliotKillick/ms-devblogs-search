What should `git checkout -` do? I’m trying to follow the excercise, but this particular command tells me that “pathspec ‘-‘ did not match any file(s) known to git”.

It means ‘check out last branch/commit’ that was checked out. An analogy to “cd -” command i suppose.This is actually a shorthand for ‘git checkout @{-1}’ which is described in docs here: https://git-scm.com/docs/gitrevisions#Documentation/gitrevisions.txt-em-ltngtemegem-1emI can’t find information about this shorthand in docs, but there is one in release notes: https://stackoverflow.com/a/7207542/350384

Is there a similar trick when splitting a file?

“Should not be doing an octopus.” is an amusing line out of context.This series is getting better and better; the idea of doing an octopus merge is one I’ll have to remember. Thanks, Raymond.
