Would it be better to create message queue explicitly like WinCreateMsgQueue in OS/2?

It is pretty rare that a message queue is created when you don't mean to create one. It is also important to note that the biggest protection here, using up a lot of memory by filling up a message queue, is still in place because it isn't possible to create a message queue accidentally for another thread. The only times that I know of that a message queue is accidentally created for the current thread...Read moreIt is pretty rare that a message queue is created when you don’t mean to create one. It is also important to note that the biggest protection here, using up a lot of memory by filling up a message queue, is still in place because it isn’t possible to create a message queue accidentally for another thread. The only times that I know of that a message queue is accidentally created for the current thread is when a cross thread function is used, like PostThreadMessage, but the target thread is the current thread.
It is pretty easy in general to know when a message queue will be created, essentially, is a window or message queue function implicitly or explicitly targets the current thread, then it is safe to assume that a message queue will be created. The only exception to this that I know of is that the main thread is always created with a message queue, IsGUIThread always returns true for the main thread.

I ran into a similar thing with GetGUIThreadInfo.
I was looking for a way to simplify figuring out if a thread was a GUI thread. IsGUIThread existed for the current thread, but I was looking for a more general way to test this. After I found that GetGUIThreadInfo would fail for other threads, I tested it on the current thread. To my surprise, it succeeded.
In the end, I used IsGUIThread for the current thread...Read moreI ran into a similar thing with GetGUIThreadInfo.
