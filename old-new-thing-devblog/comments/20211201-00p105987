std::move is badly named since it doesn’t move anything, nor does it fail to compile if nothing will be moved. (Not that I’m any good at naming things. And there’s not even a way to make it fail to cast only to const T&.)

std::move can in fact be dangerous if misused: if one writes auto &&x = std::move(compute()); where compute() returns a prvalue, x becomes dangling after the statement is evaluated.
