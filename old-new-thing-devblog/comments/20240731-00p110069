This is one of the downsides of supporting pointers in a language. There are modern value semantic languages such as Hylo that don’t have pointers (based on what is said on its website frontpage) where this kind of bin packing should be allowable. My favorite example is Julia, which can do array-of-structs-to-struct-of-arrays conversions automatically; you don’t even get your structs sitting in memory in one piece!
