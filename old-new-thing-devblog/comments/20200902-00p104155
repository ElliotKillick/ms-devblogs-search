Irony I was looking for this method yesterday (co_awaiting a vector of independent tasks). I found this code in the WinRT repo… but it’s not exposed in the currently shipping WindowsSDK; I assume it will ship with 16.8 or 16.9.
Extra credit: Any reason there can’t be a ranges version if __cpp_lib_ranges is defined?
