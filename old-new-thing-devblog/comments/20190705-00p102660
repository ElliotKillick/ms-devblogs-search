Itâ€™s *convenient* to be able to map a network drive from these dialog boxes!

Can we also have a button that launces the calculator there? I might want to do some maths when opening a file.

Hardly a relevant comparison, the Calculator can be started from the start menu in seconds while mapping a drive could be annoying if UAC/RunAs has been used on the running app and the mapped drives are not the same as your main Explorer shell.

The split-button is a Vista thing, the Windows 95 style dialog also has a checkbox control.
