So how many times do I have to reproduce the bug to poke Microsoft to look into it? If I configure full dumps to file as per https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wer/collecting-user-mode-dumps does it suppress reporting crashes to Microsoft?

There is no magic number that says “Once there are N instances, a bug gets filed.” It depends on many factors, such as how the failure rate compares with other failures, whether the failure rate has changed significantly, the nature of the failure. (I don’t know how this settings affect error reporting.)

Hmmm, I’m curious about whether the bucket statistics are done locally or jointly. In the latter case, the contribution of statistics (i.e., reporting that a bug in a certain bucket ID happened at all) could be subject to privacy regulations.
