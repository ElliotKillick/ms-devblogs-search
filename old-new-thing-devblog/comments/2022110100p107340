In Polish it says “WybierzAdministrator”, missing the space between words. I wonder if the original English string is “Select “, containing the space at the end, and whatever process of translation it went through trimmed the trailing whitespace, not deeming it important.

Thanks for pointing this out. Looks like an issue with the translation infrastructure. The trailing space got trimmed before being presented for translation, and nobody added the space back after translation. I’ll file a bug.

Windows 7 SP1? So that’s as far as your backlog still goes? 😉
Also I was thinking the banner message could use an overhaul. Display full product name, like in winver.exe, and perhaps whoami, e.g. my computer would show:
Microsoft Windows 10 Enterprise N 2016 LTSB [Version 10.0.14393.5427]

Many times I’ve sat waiting for a command to finish,  only to find I’d accidently highlighted a space on the screen and the whole console is paused waiting for me to do something with it.
Often happens when clicking on a window to bring it into focus when it already had focus.

Reminds me of the old “Who is General Failure and why is he reading my hard drive?”

Yeah, the selection in cmd/powersheell is weird. Or maybe it's the copy and paste both being on the same button (right mouse button). I've seen it many times when someone wants to paste something into cmd/powershell, so they copy the thing, click cmd/powershell to give it focus, right click and nothing, because they selected an empty cell and copied it, so now you have to find the thing again to copy it again.

It's not cmd or PowerShell. It's Windows' Console Host. From Windows 10 onward, the "quick edit" option is enabled by default. It allows you to select text directly by clicking or dragging with the left mouse button, copy the selection with a right click, or, if there is no selection, paste with the right mouse button.

And it also can be enabled in previous Windows versions (by checking the same box).
