IIRC there was a difference in default screen resolution between Windows 95 and Windows 98, which too could be an explanation for remembering them with different font sizes.

I always found it interesting real text mode did 8×14 (at least in my experience; I’ve heard 8×16 was also a thing, I assume it varied by hardware) but Windows did 8×12. I guess there was a bit of whitespace they could tighten up in there.
