Correction, there are actually 4 APC types, QUEUE_USER_APC_FLAGS_SPECIAL_USER_APC is the 4th.

Interesting! Say I have one or more signaled event objects and one or more user APCs queued for the current thread. If I enter an alertable wait state for the event objects with a call to WaitForMultipleObectsEx, who wins first? Events or APCs?

Looks like APCs are still dispatched (WAIT_IO_COMPLETION), after that WAIT_OBJECT_0 is returned (WAIT_OBJECT_0 + an offset in case of multiple events).
