“A player on the batting team scores a run by touching all the bases in sequence, ending at home plate.”
Does he get to bat again? or he has to leave and the next batter faces the pitcher?

The batters take their turn in the declared batting order. Once the batter hits a fair ball (or strikes out or is awarded a base), the batting phase is over.

Also, to really enjoy the game, you need to understand the rare but exciting “triple play”.  🙂  
Baseball proceeds at its own leisurely pace, with intervals of exciting things happening.

Sounds rather like cricket then. Doesn’t last 5 days though.

"An inning is completed when each team has had a turn at bat and a turn in the field."
That is not correct.  A half-inning is completed when the team who is on offense that half-inning has three OUTS recorded against it.  Two half-innings make one inning.  :-) 
Your text makes it sound like all players from one team get to bat.

My husband thinks that one team should have 27 outs, following by the other team having 27 outs.  That is interesting, but it would be a different game.  “Runners left on base” are a big part of any game.

“When three players from the batting team have been put out, the fielding team comes to bat, and the batting team takes the field.” So you don’t get to bat indefinitely.

You do if you avoid getting three outs. (In some, all?, little league and inning ends when all players have batted, even without three outs.)

No mention of the existance of field specific ground rules as an ‘Other Note’?  Always interesting when some field specific event happens.

Interesting, but unlikely to occur in a typical game, and even aficionados of the game don’t understand all the ground rules.

May want to add that “Whenever the batter is awarded a base, all preceding runners are forced to advance, including the runner on third base who is forced to home plate to score a run” next to the line about “walk” for the sake of completeness.

It is not the case that all preceding runners are forced. They are forced only if there are no intervening empty bases.
