of course now we need to know who got hired because of that ad, was it anyone of note that would be well known.

Even Microsoft didn’t know about pro-grammar (cue the terrible pun).

Perhaps in trying to simplify English spelling Mr. Webster actually ended up making it more complicated?

I wonder how “programer” is supposed to be pronounced.  Like /prəˈɡreɪmər/?

Obviously, the typo is that they meant “pro gamers”, as Microsoft had a vision to become the first e-sports league in the world. When a bunch of programmers applied, they suddenly pivoted into making OSes instead… /s

At least two dictionaries recognize “programer,” one as a US spelling, the other listed as a variant used “less commonly”:
https://www.thefreedictionary.com/programer
https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/programer
I’m adopting it any time soon, though.

“for micro-processors”. Was there other non-micro processors at that time?

At the time there would still have been mainframes and other large computers where the CPU wasn’t a single chip microprocessor but was actually a bunch of chips.

I usually see the “programer” typo in video games. It turns out it’s very common in end-game credits. I first noticed it in Zelda 2, and once you’re aware of it you see it everywhere. Still, it’s a bit more curious to see that typo from an American company.

Better than trying to to word-break on ‘mer”, I guess.

It wouldn’t have been a problem if they hadn’t capitalized “computer”.
