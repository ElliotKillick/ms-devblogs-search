Funny then that Herb Sutter opposes the use of exceptions to report precondition violations (p0709r4).  I side with Sutter on this matter.

There are two different scenarios. One is production (precondition violation = death), and the other is unit testing (where you intentionally violate a precondition to see what happens). The idea is that you can have the exception inside a #ifdef _REPORT_PRECONDITION_VIOLATION_AS_EXCEPTION_FOR_TESTING block which is off in production but turned on by the unit test.

I don’t see value in testing code’s behavior when called with the wrong preconditions, because you won’t be calling them with the wrong preconditions anyway in useful code.  For debug builds, I prefer firing assertions over throwing exceptions on precondition violations.
This is different from actual runtime failures that do not result from incorrect programming (e. g. I/O errors), which do require defined behavior on failure (and thus should be tested for failure).
