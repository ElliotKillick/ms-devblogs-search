Similar behavior:
For a very same product, manufacturer labels a “online store models” which legally makes it different from models sold in physical stores.
There will even be different models for different online resellers.

Yup. See also mattress manufacturers and stores for another example of this slimy trick.

It’s almost like capitalism in the US was designed to favor the big corporations who bought all those politicians, instead of the consumer who proponents always say reap the benefits of capitalism.
