Aside with WizTree, I also suggest SpaceSniffer (by Uderzo Software) as a simpler alternative.

it is funny this came out just now, I just 3 days ago merged a .NET version bump into my codebase and was planning on writing an email telling my co-workers about the various places to clean up, including the symbol cache.
Another easy place with a similar problem (if you are doing .NET development) is the two NuGet caches. (%localappdata%\NuGet\v3-cache) and (%userprofile%\.nuget\packages)
