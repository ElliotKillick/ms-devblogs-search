Btw, is it still illegal to share photos of Eiffel Tower taken at night?

Dogs are not allowed, but there can be cats and birds. //kidding
I wonder if “scooter” is missing in the list, since it’s often found adjacent to “rollerblade”.
I’m surprised to find “nunchucks” on the list. They can just add “weapons” there to make the list shorter.

And what would the icon be for “weapons”? Perhaps a set of nunchucks.

I believe the most common ones are image of gun, knife or both.
And “Flags not allowed” somewhat surprise me, as lots of guides of travel agents use flags to lead their tour members.

Looking more closely at the icon, I see that there is a number next to it, presumably a size limit. I didn’t get a clear photo, but it might be 120cm. So really the prohibition is against large flags.

I wonder what kind of icon represents “racist or violent literature”.
Also, no dynamite? Spoilsports.

A book with the words “Racism” and “Violence” next to it. Kind of cheating to use words in an icon if you ask me.
