According to the docs of RegOpenKeyEx:
> The lpSubKey parameter can be NULL only if hKey is one of the predefined keys.
I assume that itâ€™s not the assumption in your code? Perhaps you can use DuplicateHandle?

According to MSDN:
> WT_EXECUTEINPERSISTENTTHREAD
> Note that currently no worker thread is truly persistent, although worker threads do not terminate if there are any pending I/O requests.
Can you explain what that means? Is pending RegNotifyChangeKeyValue treated as a pending I/O request?
