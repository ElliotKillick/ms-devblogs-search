How is this implemented for non-domain things, such as IIS APPPOOL\Web App? Or conversely, how does it work for domain-like things that aren’t traditional domains, such as logging into Entra ID?

The period (.) always represents the current context.

The current folder (in CLI)
Local computer
To refer SQL instance in the local machine like .\SQLEXPRESS
The User’s home directory (from the Windows Run dialog)

All of those period operators are separately implemented in their respective domains. It would be great if there were a universal resource tree, you know, like a “Shell Namespace”.

I always default to \user. This prevents me from the questioning whether the . is resolved on my machine or the remote machine.
