This long post just to sell the new Raymond Chen Pillow Radios (TM)?  🙂
Do people really use all that new stuff with C++? It’s really really hard to read, and especially to debug half a year later when you’ve forgotten every detail. Maybe I am getting old.

Pillow radios may not exist, but the next best(?) thing, pillows with incorporated bluetooth speakers (and charging cable!) are actually a thing 😀

In Swedish, when used as the first element of a compound word, “kudde” typically becomes “kudd-“, so I suspect the word used in the show was actually “kuddradio”. (Examples: “kuddkrig”, “kuddöverdrag”)

Thanks! I struggle to comprehend even children’s programs because they talk faster than I can parse.

Who said “there is no such thing as a pillow-radio”? 🙂

I’m starting to think that C++ is now only useful for thought experiments.

When I was still in high school (graduated 2003) I kinda understood C++. Didn't get the template part, but the rest was OK-ish. Then I started programming professionally and didn't touch it anymore.

Didn’t get the template part, but the rest was OK-ish. Then I started programming professionally and didn’t touch it anymore. StackOverflow showed up some years later and by reading C++ questions there I realized that I actually don’t know sh*t about the language and became fascinated by it. It seemed difficult, but very powerful and expressive. Then a few years ago I decided to try reading a book about it to finally fill my gaps of knowledge. I didn’t get past the first few chapters before starting to feel disgusted and abandoned the effort.
What I realized is that they went down completely the wrong path. It seems that when they tried to add new object-oriented strings and collections to the standard library they decided that they want them to work with the old SYNTAX. Syntax which was meant for pointers. So you get a whole TON of operator overloading which not only makes the code unintuitive and untraceable (how do you even find out whether an operator is overloaded or not?), but also makes it look nonsensical (Incrementing an OBJECT? What does that even MEAN?)
So today I’m still amused by it and constantly keep finding new things in these posts, but it really feels like morbid curiosity rather than an actual fascination.

This is starting to look like std::visit painfulness…… I’m aware of the language-level discriminated union proposal, but right now I’m just in need for a visit function that let me take compile-time alternative indices so that I can work correctly with variants that may contain multiple identically typed alternatives
