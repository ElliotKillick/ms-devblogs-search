Unfortunately, the MSVC compiler does not always generate a tail call even if it’s technically possible. The small functions like in your example will be optimized, but larger functions won’t and it’s not always obvious why. In Clang, you can use the musttail attribute, but there is nothing similar in MSVC.

It seems “add” is missing from the assembly.
