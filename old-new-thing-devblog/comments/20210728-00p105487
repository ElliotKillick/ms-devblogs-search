How do WM_GESTURE and WM_TOUCH come into the picture?
Which is translated into which or does third component generate them?

Hey Raymond, can you shed some light on these two quirks when using Office?
First, open Excel, save a document in that Microsoft Excel location; you get “You can’t save here. Please choose another location.”. Why does that even exist?
Second, if you click “Hide Folders” in that save dialog, you suddenly see more tags to assign to the document. Why is that not an obvious thing?
Thanks!

First, you'd better post this in an Excel forum, where you're more likely to get a good answer. (Preferably, avoid a Microsoft-operated forum.)
Second, no, you can't save in the "Microsoft Excel" location. You have to browse into its nodes. If you don't see any nodes, be sure to have signed in with your Microsoft 365 account. Then, verify if the locations are set up.
Third, "tags" as you call them, appear both when folders are shown...Read moreFirst, you’d better post this in an Excel forum, where you’re more likely to get a good answer. (Preferably, avoid a Microsoft-operated forum.)

Third, “tags” as you call them, appear both when folders are shown and when they are hidden. You just have to resize the Save As… window to see them. However, when the folders are shown, the focus must be the folders. After all, what’s the use of a button that says “Show folders” but doesn’t do such a thing? You can change tags elsewhere in Excel, i.e., in the Info tab of the backstage screen.
