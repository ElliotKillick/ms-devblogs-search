August 27, 2007 you wrote an article titles "Yes indeed, all Microsoft files are (or should be) digitally signed". Your site implied I would be able to leave a comment if I signed in, so I did. And THEN your site informed me comments are not allowed on that post. So I am posting here.

Less than 25% of Microsoft’s files are signed in that system folder alone on my pc. I just reinstalled and updated Windows 10 so my system is fairly typical. Some of those unsigned files routinely access the internet as well. BiniSoft Windows Firewall Control can notify you when this happens and allow you to block them. Frankly Microsoft SHOULD be signing ALL files that access the internet for security reasons. “WaaSMedicAgent.exe” is a MS file that is not signed and accesses the internet regularly. I have even seen some MS files try to access the web using http instead of https which I also block for obvious security reasons.

Most OS files are catalog-signed, rather than containing an embedded certificate.
