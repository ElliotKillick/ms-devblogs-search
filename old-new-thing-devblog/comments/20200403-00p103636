It‚Äôs odd: I read some really smart stuff here ‚Äì from both Raymond and the folk who add their comments, and then at work I have to use Microsoft Teams, surely one of the most clunky and badly-written pieces of awful software that ever existed. And I wonder just where Microsoft is going.

Microsoft is a fine company. It has some great products, such as Windows or Office, but not everything it makes is as good. Microsoft Teams, the "modern" Skype, Windows Home Server (an interesting but unnecessary concept), all the .NET nonsense they pushed onto us instead of creating "COM 3.0" and letting us continue using our existing code...

But big companies use to lose contact with their customers. Apple and Google have had some big bloopers of their own (the Newton, the Chromebook, Hangouts‚Ä¶) and, in the case of Apple, some of their half-backed products have had some success just because of the fanboys: the original iPhone was good looking, but could do less than either a Palm, a Pocket PC or even a Symbian OS Nokia‚Ä¶ it couldn‚Äôt even copy and paste text or install third-party apps!

Ah yes C++/COM 3.0 would've been a tremendous success. Oh wait they tried (more than once) and it failed because it was a miserable experience.
There's a reason nobody writes new business software in C++ using COM. Having a language that nobody can understand fully that took two  decades to get a semi-working module system going (not that it's finished just yet or handles things such as modules for the standard library, but give it...Read moreAh yes C++/COM 3.0 would‚Äôve been a tremendous success. Oh wait they tried (more than once) and it failed because it was a miserable experience.
There‚Äôs a reason nobody writes new business software in C++ using COM. Having a language that nobody can understand fully that took two  decades to get a semi-working module system going (not that it‚Äôs finished just yet or handles things such as modules for the standard library, but give it another decade and they‚Äôll probably have figured that one out too) turns out is not great for productivity.
Also thinking that the iPhone was a big success because of the huge number of Apple fan boys in 2008 completely misunderstands the whole reason for its success. Admittedly Microsoft, Nokia and Palm didn‚Äôt understand it either, so no reason to feel bad about it. One could notice that neither of the aforementioned companies is relevant in the phone business anymore today exactly for their lack of imagination and misunderstanding the reasons for the iPhones success.

That would be a great comment if one considers it a giant piece of sarcasm.
Anyway, Microsoft did release the next version of COM in 2012. I won‚Äôt tell you its name but I give you a hint: Raymond‚Äôs next blog post (after this one) is about said next version.

I‚Äôm sure if either you or your colleague had seen a person actually putting iPad to good use, you‚Äôd be sure to take that story to the grave, especially when the chair-throwing Steve Balmer was your CEO. Never underestimate fanaticism.
Result: Apple replaced Microsoft as the most valuable company in the world.

I think it is a good observation though. The set of people consuming content is much larger than the set of people creating content, so if you‚Äôre successful at selling things to that first group you‚Äôre going to make hay.

When the iPad launched, I saw it as a netbook without keyboard, and thus, useless for anything that wasn't watching videos or pictures. Amazing, magic, you name it. But unable to do productive work (try to write a single line of Java or PHP with a virtual keyboard and you'll know what I mean). Apple has tried to market the iPad as a "creative tool", but hasn't had much success.

Amazing, magic, you name it. But unable to do productive work (try to write a single line of Java or PHP with a virtual keyboard and you‚Äôll know what I mean). Apple has tried to market the iPad as a ‚Äúcreative tool‚Äù, but hasn‚Äôt had much success. The consensus nowadays is that tablets and smartphones are content consumption devices, and laptops and desktops, content creation devices. It‚Äôs easy to see why sales have stabilized in the last years (PCs sales have stopped to drop, tablet and smartphones have stopped to rise).
About adding a case and an external keyboard to a tablet‚Ä¶ well, you end with a chunky, fragile setup which is often heavier and thicker than some light laptops (i.e., Apple‚Äôs Mac Book Air, which is marvelous), and on top of it you have to take care of charging the keyboard‚Äôs battery in addition to the tablet‚Äôs one (or attaching a messy side cable to the tablet‚Äôs USB/Lighting port).

iPads can have keyboards now, but you still don‚Äôt see many people using them as a laptop replacement.

The seminars I attend have plenty of people using iPad with keyboard to take notes. May not do everything a laptop can but still good enough that a person can get by even at the things the iPad isn‚Äôt optimum for.

As I keep saying: I didn't learn to type when I was 8 years old just to go back to finger painting.
