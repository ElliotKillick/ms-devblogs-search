Thank you very much for this. I would like to know however, how to boot as System/NT Authority.
The same privilege level granted during windows setup and Audit mode.
Thanks in advance.

The title of this post is slightly misleading because this code checks how the token was born, not if it‚Äôs elevated. You can make a Full elevated token with a lower integrity level. To actually check for elevation, you need TokenIntegrityLevel >= SECURITY_MANDATORY_HIGH_RID.

What's more, if what you really want to know is whether the token has administrative privileges, checking the integrity level doesn't work either. :-)

The other case is when you are signed in as a standard user but elevated using explicit administrative credentials.  I‚Äôm not sure what the token elevation type is in this case, it might not be as easy to detect.

My guess is that it‚Äôs TokenElevationTypeDefault if UAC disabled, and TokenElevationTypeFull if UAC enabled. That is, the same as when the administrator is elevated (or always-elevated).

I did some testing and was unable to elevate when UAC was turned off (i.e., with the local group policy security option "User Account Control: Run all administrators in Admin Approval Mode" set to "Disabled").
With UAC turned on, logged in as a standard user, and elevating to the local administrator account, you get TokenElevationTypeDefault if "User Account Control: Admin Approval Mode for the Built-in Administrator account" is disabled or TokenElevationTypeFull if it is enabled.

If I remember rightly, UAC has been enabled for the built-in administrator account by default for some time now, so probably not a scenario the original customer would have needed to worry about too much.

Re: Can you elevate with UAC disabled?
Yes. I have UAC disabled on my daily driver computer and use 2 separate accounts and elevate by entering the credential. If the policy is set to deny elevation for limited users, there might be a problem, but I would expect one could always ‚Äúrunasuser‚Äù (Run as different user).

If UAC is disabled, do you even get the opportunity to elevate?
