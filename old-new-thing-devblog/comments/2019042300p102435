Still not clear why it’s related to “Ultimate Extra download”. It’s not like Windows Ultimate Edition is not available at places where “gambling is illegal or severely frowned upon”.

The gambling meant that the game was not E-rated (“all audiences”), so it wasn’t suitable for including in the default product. Making it a separate download avoided that problem: Downloading could be blocked by policy, and installation requires admin privileges.
