From the linked article:
"Pivot points can be used in two ways. The first way is to determine the overall market trend. If the pivot point price is broken in an upward movement, then the market is bullish. If the price drops through the pivot point, then it's is bearish."
Such deep insights we are getting here. (It does say before that that the most rapid price movements are expected near the pivot point, which does make...Read moreFrom the linked article:
“Pivot points can be used in two ways. The first way is to determine the overall market trend. If the pivot point price is broken in an upward movement, then the market is bullish. If the price drops through the pivot point, then it’s is bearish.”
Such deep insights we are getting here. (It does say before that that the most rapid price movements are expected near the pivot point, which does make this slightly more meaningful. But not much.)
The second way is “to use pivot point price levels to enter and exit the markets”, which is what Peter Cooper was talking about.
I did find these two (consecutive!) paragraphs interesting, however:
“While at times it appears that the levels are very good at predicting price movement, there are also times when the levels appear to have no impact at all. Like any technical tool, profits won’t likely come from relying on one indicator exclusively.
“The success of a pivot point system lies squarely on the shoulders of the trader and depends on their ability to effectively use it in conjunction with other forms of technical analysis. […]”
So you’re saying the tool sometimes works and sometimes completely fails (because it’s essentially an exercise in assuming past trends will continue into the future), but it’s the trader’s fault if it desn’t work for them?

Something I wrote a few years ago:
04.07.07  Stock market: glorified loansharking. You lend companies money in return for what you hope will be a usorious interest rate.
And that ‘interest rate’ is actually set by what other investors think of the stock.
Consider it an experiment in mob psychology, with your money riding on the outcome.

If the first point of “Using Pivot Points For Predictions” is “Don’t use Pivot Points For Predictions” than it sounds right to me.

I occasionally glance through financial news, and each day, you can expect to see headlines of one of the following forms:
- Markets surge after positive earnings reports
- Markets end mixed amid positive earnings reports
- Markets plunge despite positive earnings reports
or whatever factor somebody thought had influence - jobs report, trade talks, volcanos, some world leader sneezing, etc.  It must take a great deal of insight to do "analysis" of the...Read moreI occasionally glance through financial news, and each day, you can expect to see headlines of one of the following forms:

Many of those financial news reports are written by algorithms.

My best understanding of "technical analysis" is that to the extent it "works", it's that if a lot of people buy expecting a price to go up then that's what will happen (and vice-versa, if a lot of people sell because they expect the price to go down then that's what will happen). So if you can get a large-enough group to people to agree on "rules" on when to buy or sell, their collective...Read moreMy best understanding of “technical analysis” is that to the extent it “works”, it’s that if a lot of people buy expecting a price to go up then that’s what will happen (and vice-versa, if a lot of people sell because they expect the price to go down then that’s what will happen). So if you can get a large-enough group to people to agree on “rules” on when to buy or sell, their collective action can, to some degree, be self-fulfilling. (Note that I’m making no claim about whether this group of people would actually make more money trading than an average person not following their “strategy”.)
But yes, it seems to me that there’s a lot of double-speak, trying to make people feel like they’re in on some amazing “secret of the market” and that it’s a fun gambling game, when people should just invest in boring broad-market index funds and be done with it.
