If you want humans to understand it, then you should generate the same kind of words that developers think when they review code.
Just pick a handful of random explitives and insults and you’ll be fine. Bonus points if you can generate an image macro.

I'm extremely glad that my "connect" item, from 2006, about a poor error message in SQL is finally getting fixed.  (When inserting data into a SQL table, the old error message said "String or binary data would be truncated" but did not say which column.  The new error message gives the name of the column and some of the data.  That's very helpful when there may be scores of columns in the table.)

Yes, writing error messages is hard. 
 
Sometimes it takes more than a decade to improve an error message…

It's opt-in via a trace flag and I wonder if it will never be on by default.  There is an argument to be made that displaying that information to an end user is a potential security problem.  One recommendation I read was to keep it off, then turn it on when you need it for troubleshooting purposes.
I am glad your "connect" item was finally addressed.  It was a frustrating error to try to diagnose.

I followed the link, but I didn’t spot any renamed parameters, let alone how the rename would break anything…

“AllJoyn: Refresh generated code to fix build breaks.” Somebody renamed a parameter, and that broke the AllJoyn samples.

I could see a problem where you’re naming your arguments, so if I have some code:
myService.Execute(actionName: “Fetch”)
It’s going to depend on the declaration being ‘Execute(string actionName)’ and would break if the owner of Execute changed the decl to ‘Execute(string action)’.

I discovered this when they asked us to write a Pascal compiler in school. Error reporting is a huge and complicated area.
