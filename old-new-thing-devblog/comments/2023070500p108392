There’s no such thing as a zero sized object in C++, but there are zero sized base classes.  If coroutine_frame_storage derived from the biggest type (and was aligned as the most stringent type) then you could save … a whole byte.
Given you’ve already over-allocate by a x4 “just in case the compiler decides it needs more overhead”, it’s probably not worth it
