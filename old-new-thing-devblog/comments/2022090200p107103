The OnCurrentWidgetChanged declaration should be STDMETHOD, not STDMETHODIMP.

If the variable order matters then I’d stick a comment pointing it out, this seems like a trap for developers in a hurry.

IMO it would be more appropriate to create a scope explicitly. Something like
HRESULT WidgetTracker::OnCurrentWidgetChanged()
{
    WRL::ComPtr widget;
    {
        auto guard = std::lock_guard(m_mutex);
        RETURN_IF_FAILED(GetCurrentWidget(&widget));
        m_currentWidget.Swap(widget);
    }
    return S_OK;
}

Indeed, moreover a lock guard that isn't at the top of its scope immediately sticks out as a "bug" that the next guy may be tempted to "fix", since it is the usual assumption that you want to hold the lock for the entire scope.

> If the variable order matters then I’d stick a comment pointing it out,
Henke37, you may have missed the rest of this blog post that comments on that very same topic. I would have assumed the code samples are kept succinct to demonstrate the issue encountered and how to solve them.
