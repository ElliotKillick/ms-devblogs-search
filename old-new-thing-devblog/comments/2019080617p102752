Sorry for being off-topic, but I just noticed that most of the comments aren’t displayed unless I am logged in. Always wondered about the lack of comments since the last blog migration. Couldn’t find anything in the FAQs.
Your processor series is one of my favorites! I am just worried that SH-3 might be the grand finale…

"Accessing global variables is typically done in two steps: First, load the address of the global variable from a constants pool near your function, and then dereference that address to access the global variable itself."I assume that the original purpose of the GBR was to point at all time at the global variables table (which could change across library boundaries too I expect) giving code easy access to 256 global variables. And that Microsoft (or...Read more“Accessing global variables is typically done in two steps: First, load the address of the global variable from a constants pool near your function, and then dereference that address to access the global variable itself.”I assume that the original purpose of the GBR was to point at all time at the global variables table (which could change across library boundaries too I expect) giving code easy access to 256 global variables. And that Microsoft (or someone) considered it to be more valuable as a general-purpose address register.

Apologies for the lack of comments as late, the new software makes commenting a real pain.
On topic: This architecture reminds me of the M68k in the fact that it's probably better suited to microcontrollers based on how the instruction format works. It seems to favor semi sloppy tiny binaries rather than well thought out page managed items like Itaninium did. (TBF Itanium has a lot of really really nice things that got trashed because...Read moreApologies for the lack of comments as late, the new software makes commenting a real pain.

It seems to favor semi sloppy tiny binaries rather than well thought out page managed items like Itaninium did. (TBF Itanium has a lot of really really nice things that got trashed because VLIW didn’t really work out at the time). Given I can’t seem to find references to virtual memory support this seems to fit with that theory.

You can still run Linux on Super-H processors (other than SH-1), and that’s not a “nommu” port. I’m fairly sure WinCE required paged memory management too.
