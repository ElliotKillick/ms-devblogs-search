Those functions should've been updated to return UINT64 on 64-bit OS, the result is in RAX, which is 64-bit register, anyway.
MSG struct field 'time' also should've been extended, the MSG struct contains useless padding anyway. IMHO it wouldn't break any compatibility.
Same for GetLastInputInfo. It could've been easily extended to support some hypothetical LASTINPUTINFOEX with 64-bit time, and all the developers around the world, who need this functionality, could have avoided doing the complicated, and...Read moreThose functions should’ve been updated to return UINT64 on 64-bit OS, the result is in RAX, which is 64-bit register, anyway.

Same for GetLastInputInfo. It could’ve been easily extended to support some hypothetical LASTINPUTINFOEX with 64-bit time, and all the developers around the world, who need this functionality, could have avoided doing the complicated, and error-prone, subtractions. But for some infuriating and frustrating reasons, that elude me, Microsoft refuses.
And not just this. I could easily collect hundreds of such small details that could be described as API rot.

I find assuming that auto update will reboot the server every month disturbing. We’ve had server core installs go longer than that because they managed to have no patches on a patch cycle.

The switch to Unix file deletion semantics ought to have made most patch reboots a thing of the past. Sets and Activities were a brilliant way to counter the total loss of user workflow that results from a reboot, but then the concept disappeared. It feels like we’re all the targets of Project Mayhem.

The big issue comes when you see CVEs for kernel and driver exploits which are fixed by a patch. As an example, the December updated included updates to ntoskernel.exe and ntfs.sys.
I also ask other people who complain about the system have to restart for updates the simple question of when do they sleep? This is an important question because sleeping would be a perfect time for the system to restart, and you have to...Read moreThe big issue comes when you see CVEs for kernel and driver exploits which are fixed by a patch.

This is an important question because sleeping would be a perfect time for the system to restart, and you have to be doing something wrong if your workflow can’t handle you sleeping.

In fact, if your computer only sees use during the 40 hours you’re at work, your company is wasting at least 75% of the capability/benefit/value/etc that the computer can provide.

You know, there was a word in initial comment that you may have missed. The word was “server”.

That does not really help though, does it? You then have running processes using the old files, and newly started with the new files. Sounds like a perfect road to chaos.
