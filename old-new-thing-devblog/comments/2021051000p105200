To quote John Carmack: “4KB pages feel silly on a 64 bit operating system.”

Would be quite interested in knowing more about that 64bit Alpha version of Windows

Raymond has many posts about the Alpha: doing a search for "AXP" gets the majority of them, although it also returns articles on how the chip itself worked. All interesting and informative in my opinion!

I think Itanium machines are hard to find now as they’re most likely to be servers. However for PowerPCs, I think eBay is still selling second hand Apple PowerMac G4 that runs on it.
Oops, just search and it seems you can buy second hand HP Itanium servers on eBay too.

Shouldn’t there be 3rd column for huge (1GB) pages? Supported on x86-64 and AArch64.
Any maybe 4th for 512GB ones (brutal, gigantic?) if the rumor I’ve heard about LA57 is true. Although I haven’t seen any API, so that’d probably be just —.

At the moment, PML5E entries for a present page MUST have the PS bit set to 0, indicating that they reference a PML4 table, not a gigantic page. There’s room for Intel or AMD to expand this to support 512GB pages later, but it’s not permitted right now.

Thanks for clarifying that.
