when you went
u 00007fff`ad9f9140-20 00007fff`ad9f9140
how did you figure out you should back up by 20? You could have gotten garbage since instructions are variable size. I usually use “ub” and hope it does some magic for me. Or did you ommit incrementing the size until you got a plausible result?
