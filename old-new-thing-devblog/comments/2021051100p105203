Neat!  It still works in 21h1.

I expected the hack to be bleeding off the edge of screen, like maximized windows. ü§î

Why right-click and left-click when you can double-right-click? (With a few notable exceptions, you can right-click to activate items in context menus.) Of course I never use my desktop so the whole shortcut is wasted on me.
What I have noticed recently is that the Alt+Tab popup now* steals activation from the current window, which can be distracting depending on how the current application reacts to losing activation.

IMO, this is a hack done at the wrong place. A better solution would be to get the start button to really take all the pixels, including the edge/corner ones, and then there wouldn‚Äôt be a need to artificially move the mouse. Fun fact: This was actually done in the Windows XP default ‚ÄúLuna‚Äù theme, AKA ‚ÄúFisher-price theme‚Äù.

The Start button DOES take all the pixels.  Try it yourself.  You can slam your mouse all the way to the edge, and still be able to click on the button.
This ‚Äúhack‚Äù is done to position the mouse inside the popup menu that appears when you right-click on the Start menu, which otherwise would not be aligned, simply due to how popup menus work.

You‚Äôre right, my complaint only applies to the pre-Windows XP taskbars (or Windows XP with classic theme), which I still remember.

Wow, never noticed this. Just tried it and the pointer positions itself to last menu item.

Sadly, this doesn‚Äôt seem to move the cursor enough when the taskbar is on the side of the screen. I am noticing now that the cursor moves to the side by a few pixels, but it also needs to move down a few pixels to reach the top item of the menu.

I know of a different but related effect that can be confusing. If you put the cursor at the very bottom of the screen and click anywhere within the horizontal bounds of the notification area/tray, it will send the click to the last tray item that was activated regardless of what X position the cursor is actually at. ü§î

As for the start-button effect, I‚Äôm not seeing it, but that might be because I don‚Äôt have a start-button; I remove it with 7+ Taskbar Tweaker. ü§∑ (I tried restoring the button but it still didn‚Äôt jump; maybe this only works if you‚Äôre using a theme and/or Windows 10‚ÄîI use the Classic Windows non-theme in Windows 7.)

That‚Äôs not so in Windows 10 (at least in the Enterprise version we use). Clicking on the bottom pixel row in the taskbar region seems to send the click to the notification icon that is immediately above the mouse X position.

Having never noticed this I had to try it. Worked. Interesting to know.
Then I tried the ‚Äúclick bottom of taskbar‚Äù and noticed that it did *not* work. It does activate the program icon, but the mouse doesn‚Äôt jump up the few pixels. So I clicked back to the referenced blog post and noticed that it‚Äôs from 2015. So the behavior of the mouse on the taskbar changed sometime between then and now.

I seem to recall this comment, even though it's no longer visible.  IIRC, the mouse move was only visible on Windows 7 when Windows Aero was turned off, and Windows Classic was enabled.
Maybe it needed desktop composition turned off?  I don't recall the specifics, but it was something like that.

But that means that for me the special-status menu item is the one at the top of the right-click menu, which for regular users would be the hardest to reach (Apps and Features). I feel like this particular feature is maybe too undiscoverable? But also I‚Äôve never wanted to move the mouse, click, click again to achieve what WIN+D can do. If only it were ‚ÄúWindows Mobility Center‚Äù or one of the things in that menu I use! Still, these little subtle UI tweaks are nice to have and fun to learn about!
