For a while, everything was “terrific”, a word that I thought had died out in the 1950s, but right now where I work, everyone is always “beyond thrilled” about everything. Many of my colleagues are so far “beyond thrilled” they’ve come around full circle to abject misery.

At Amazon, “surprise and delight” was one of our core product principles — pretty sure I’ve seen “Alex is surprised and delighted that [AWS] makes it so easy to zondrize Blorg tickets for Foo.”

If the spec doesn’t say that Alex is thrilled with Windows, then it won’t tie into an overall theme, and features that don’t fit into a theme are likely to be cut 🙂

Of course not. It would end with “This new API empowers Alex to achieve more efficient ticket zondrization.”
