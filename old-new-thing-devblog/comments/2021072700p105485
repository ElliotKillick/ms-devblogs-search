I installed Windows 8 Costumer Preview on a all in one pc with touchscreen when I was 12. That’s my earliest memory about prerelease version of Windows…

* Twitter had a technical-support phone-number. Like apparently every company these days (*cough*YouTube*cough* ¬_¬), their official customer-support department is now, well, Twitter (and to a lesser extent, Facebook). 😒 But can you blame them when the White House’s Press Room was Twitter for four years? 🤦

Can you imagine the support tech’s reaction?
MS: “Hi, this is Taylor from Microsoft”
TW: “… yeah right!”

Tech-support scammers weren’t really a thing yet in 2011, so people wouldn’t have been so skeptical at the time. 🤷

Is part of the outage attributed to the reveal of Microsoft’s then-upcoming Windows 8?

Ah, 2011. The halcyon days of people being excited about Windows 8

Ah, 2011. Couldn’t they just SMS shortcode their Tweet back then?
