I bet you hate it when debugging and rsp points to unmapped memory.
(Been there, trashed rsp, debugged that.)
On a related note I have no idea how ControlFlowGuard is supposed to work in system DLLs when the main exe is compiled without it. The function pointers to callback functions arenâ€™t known to ControlFlowGuard.

The loader probably just marks the entire text section of a non-CFG-aware binary as valid for callbacks.
