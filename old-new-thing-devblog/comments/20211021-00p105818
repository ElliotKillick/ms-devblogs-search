Surprising conclusion; I was expecting they didn’t handle WM_GETFONT message in their main window and wondered why it didn’t work.

“determine the average character dimensions” based on? A-Z?

We’re doing it based on “A-Za-z” (see https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/blob/1fb7b1381201c3a5aa0a9a975036dd2cde9e3da0/include/wx/private/window.h#L29), but this was found using empirically and could well be wrong, so I’d also like to hear from Raymond the real answer to this question. TIA!
