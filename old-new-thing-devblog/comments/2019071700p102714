Of course, the assumption here is that no further attacks against SHA-1 are found. Cryptographers don't consider SHA-1 broken so much because of the already demonstrated attacks, as because of the attacks that they expect to show up in future now that the weak spots are known. My understanding is that feasible collision attacks against a given SHA-1 hash are considered within the realm of possible.

Once the attack is out, it will be too late to start working on a Windows update.
Oh, and an attacker would of course keep LUID constant and try to change the service name in order to trigger a collision. So the limiting factor is computing power after all – something that attackers can increase at will.

Changing the service name requires administrator privileges, so that’s a non-starter. The only thing the attacker can do is get a new LUID, which is rate-limited by the computing power of the machine under attack, which the attacker cannot increase at will. That’s what makes this different from your usual SHA-1 collision attack. The attacker cannot choose anything. All the attacker can do is keep rolling the dice hoping for a winner.

I see. Not being familiar with the concept of per-user services, I assumed that users could actually install them. If the service still needs to be installed by the administrator then there is indeed no risk.

Thanks for pointing out that I had left out that important detail. Retroactively fixed.

Thanks for that. I read it for the first time with the fix already in place. 
I haven’t used per-user services. The only one I think I know of is SQL Express supporting the ability to allow users to start their own copy. As you say, the administrator of the computer is still doing the installation but then users can start their own isolated instance. 
Any other real world examples of this?
