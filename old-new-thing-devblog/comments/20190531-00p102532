The other “gotcha” with AdjustTokenPrivileges is that if the user doesn’t have the privilege(s) in question, it still reports success even though it did nothing.  (This is called out in the documentation, of course, but is often overlooked.) 
To determine whether the call actually succeeded, you need to call GetLastError, which will be set to zero if the call succeeded.

I assume it’s threadToken instead of newToken for AdjustTokenPrivileges, in the correct implementation?
