Wouldn’t “leave rest of register as is” be an option? Like moving into AL for example.

As I understand, in pipelined implementations, it’s preferable to avoid partial-register results. RISC ISAs tend to perform ALU operations on full registers and provide smaller-sized loads and stores for convenience.
68k and x86 processors retained their predecessors’ behaviour for compatibility and simply had to deal with the extra complexity when pipelined and superscalar implementations came along. Even x86-64 automatically zero-extends 32-bit results to 64 bits.

The m68k can do direct 16-to-32-bit sign-extended loads via movea.w to address registers. I suppose that’s a fairly limited incantation and could be missed easily – M68K PRM p. 4-119.
