On the other hand, in the unlikely event that you know the integer division is going to be exact, and the divisor has an inverse with respect to the base, then you can just multiply by its multiplicative inverse instead.

On the other hand, “modulo after each step” does work if you only do addition and subtraction (formally, the quotient of abelian groups R/cZ is nontrivial).
(I’m sure you know this, but it’s never explicitly stated for the readers.)

True. This article was more to address people who blindly apply the “take mod after each step” rule and then are surprised when it doesn’t work!
