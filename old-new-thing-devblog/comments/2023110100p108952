If removing WS_POPUP and adding WS_CHILD is mandatory, why doesn’t the dialog manager do it for you similar to how it removes WS_CAPTION and WS_SYSMENU?

It’s not mandatory in the sense that “if you don’t do it, the operation fails”. It is technically legal to leave those flags in place, but the results are almost certainly not what you want.
