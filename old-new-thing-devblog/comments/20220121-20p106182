Either you should have used std::unique_ptr or you’re going to have weird things happen (e.g. this). If you’re using std::shared_ptr then just accept it’s reference counted and get on with it. The speed up you get by not incrementing and decrementing the reference is not likely to make up for the ownership and liveness issues that come with trying to over-optimize.
