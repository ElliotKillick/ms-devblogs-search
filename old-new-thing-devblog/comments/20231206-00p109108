What about the option of defining a special value (when possible) to indicate the usage of the this dependant value?band use that as the default?
It’s not exactly the same, but would allow you to have only one function pointer. This is obviously not always possible, but I would believe in most cases it is.

You can at least take the address of an overload of an overloaded function, but taking the address of a function with default arguments removes all knowledge of those defaults. (In the case of a member function, you can’t even fake it using a helper.)
