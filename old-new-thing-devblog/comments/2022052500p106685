In my experience it’s better on desktop to just manually save the absolute path/PIDL than to use IFileDialog::SetClientGuid() which routinely forgets my settings after a few days.

Why are explorer thumbnails limited to a maximum of 256×256 pixels? There is registry value but increasing it doesn’t help. With 300% DPI, the font scaled a lot but the images aren’t so there is a lot of empty space in Windows Explorer between the items.
Why the limit? Why not just let it be as big as someone want it to be? That’s another Windows mystery to solve…

Because that was huge when these sizes were introduced in Windows Vista when 1280×800 was a common screen resolution? I wonder if icons are even properly handled if one would allow bigger sizes, centering them like smaller icons which do not provide bigger resolutions…

I’d be happy with 256×256 if I could get the W10 thumbnail service to stop locking up on .MKV files. When this happens on my PC, all shell context menus deadlock on creation until the offending dllhost process is terminated. A normal user would be forced to reboot.
