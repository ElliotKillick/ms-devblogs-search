I'd imagine this isn't how the coroutine ramp actually works, since if heap elision happens then the returned  will point to  which will be deallocated when  returns.

Read moretask sample()
{
    char __coro_elision_buffer[sizeof(coroutine_frame)];
    // ...

Hey!
I went to link with your suggestion for the optimization.
Reading thru the comments looks like “the bot” gives some answer in style “yeah we will maybe look at that, go away”. Then real person jumps in a few day later (yeah… two weeks, but “a few days” looks better), slaps the bot saying “behave yourself, it’s Raymond!” and happily overrides everything with “Hey, sure, right now, we will do it! Thanks Raymond!”
