Since they only had two bits to encode the type of shift, they obviously had to drop one of ROL and ROR, but I wonder why they chose ROL. (Obviously for fixed rotation amounts it makes no difference.)

When building functions at the machine level I often use something like ROL Rn to pass the Carry into a register to pass it to the higher language (eg sys read; rol r1; rts pc). I suppose on A64 the tail of functions have to have branches to sort out passing back something to indicate the Carry state (eg sys read; mov #0,r1; bcc ret; mov #1,r1; ret: rts pc).

Ah! I suppose adcs r1,r1,r1 would do it – or even adcs r1,zr,zr .

Right, every processor with a carry flag can synthesize a “rotate left with carry” instruction from “add with carry”. I’ll add a note to the article.
