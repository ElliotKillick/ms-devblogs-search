Presumably because I don’t know about await_transform yet, I’m confused as to why the cancellation needs to be checked in two places.

The await-transform lets us cancel the coroutine as soon as it performs its next co_await. Otherwise, we wouldn’t cancel it until it completed, which could be a long time coming.

All very smart, but it doesn’t explain why Teams is so awful.
