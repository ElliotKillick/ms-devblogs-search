I was really annoyed to discover that in Windows 10, they take different activation keys. I wanted to use the US N version (yes it exists; check msdn) only to discover that a normal retail key won’t activate an N edition. It was being installed in a VM with no graphics acceleration and there was zero chance that media functions would work, so why waste disk space and attack surface.

And if you wanted to display the full Windows edition name somewhere you would be facing GetProductInfo and the largest switch statement known to man, filled with undocumented values you find on random sites, so spare yourself the trouble and just don’t do it.
