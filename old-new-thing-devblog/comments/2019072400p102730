But you have to admit: that was pretty impressive.

I bet the team was rather happy to let this program keep crashing.

Oh the times you spied on windows messages to write a program that automates another that doesn’t have a public API (I’m looking at you, [popular communication program])

As bad a practice as that is, I can definitely see the allure of it - it's just clever enough and into system details to where you can almost feel like you're outsmarting the Windows team, even though you're outsmarting yourself in the long run.  I've fallen into the temptation in .Net by using GetType().GetMethod(BindingFlags.NonPublic|...) a couple of times as *temporary* workarounds, but at least in those cases, the technique is mundane enough to where...Read moreAs bad a practice as that is, I can definitely see the allure of it – it’s just clever enough and into system details to where you can almost feel like you’re outsmarting the Windows team, even though you’re outsmarting yourself in the long run.  I’ve fallen into the temptation in .Net by using GetType().GetMethod(BindingFlags.NonPublic|…) a couple of times as *temporary* workarounds, but at least in those cases, the technique is mundane enough to where I don’t get wedded to the idea

I really dislike writing about internals. The last time I did it, I basically disproved every assumption someone made on the behaviour of the VirtualAlloc family of functions when you don’t use a base address.
I tend to hate doing this the other way around because people then seem to take this as a sign that someone is giving their approval and somehow means that Microsoft will never change this behaviour.

I’m wondering how do you call such an internal function? Just load the DLL and jump to an offset? Or they make the memory search each time they need to call it?
Anyway, it seems pretty fragile as solution. I’m surprised they released in production.

Believe me, its never a pretty solution but sometimes it's surprisingly useful. Once i worked with a framework for interface components in Delphi and the only solution i could work out for a random crash was a patch on the fly to call an internal initialization function and then overwrite the first bytes of the function to write a ret to disable further calls. Over 5 senior developers tried to read the actual code to...Read moreBelieve me, its never a pretty solution but sometimes it’s surprisingly useful.

Over 5 senior developers tried to read the actual code to understand and fix the issue, but the code is such trash that my hack had been there for over 6 years now and nobody has a clue on why it crashes.

> trying to  reverse-engineer how Windows protects the settings in the registry
“Choose defaults by file type” -> .gz -> “Choose a default” -> “Look for a program in the microsoft store”
Dude let me type a command line here. (I really want to type in c:\cygwin64\bin\gzip.exe -k)
Dude let me change the icon of a file.

After a couple times I screwed myself over with “optimization” tools (hey, we all were gullible when looking back long enough) and a countless couple times more I’ve been cleaning up trash on family & friends’ computers, I dare to say than an “optimization” tool not working anymore is in fact an advancement, something to celebrate. Even more so if it’s “advanced”.
