I never expected Raymond Chen to say “so must have been some sort of glitch.”
Interesting…

Maybe "business process" means something different in our team?
For us, a business process means "When you get a request of this type from the rest of the business, there is a documented guide to handling it, which includes all the extra bits you wouldn't immediately think of and deals with all the edge cases." These documents are typically written or at least reviewed by experienced tech leads and are intended to allow anyone in the...Read moreMaybe “business process” means something different in our team?
For us, a business process means “When you get a request of this type from the rest of the business, there is a documented guide to handling it, which includes all the extra bits you wouldn’t immediately think of and deals with all the edge cases.” These documents are typically written or at least reviewed by experienced tech leads and are intended to allow anyone in the team to manage these requests. Team members using the document are expected to expand it as required if anything is unclear or any steps are missing, and to rectify anything in the documented process that is out of date or does not work.
Our business process documentation saves us significant time and effort every week and allows us to deliver higher quality. There’s always more to write and update, of course, like any other sort of documentation. But we couldn’t cope without it.
For other sorts of business process – it helps us greatly to manage our work queue to be able to insist that all our requests come through as tickets rather than chat messages or emails (we still get a lot of those, mind you, but we can then say “OK, put it in a ticket for us”). And the change management controls reduce risk overall, even if not all of them make complete sense (like the complete change embargo over the Christmas break because of the limited support available if anything breaks – including processes where the process SMEs are at work during this break to ensure continuity of the process, and go on holiday afterwards, when all the changes will be released).
Of course our organisation is far smaller than Microsoft, and our team isn’t software development per se. Maybe that makes a difference. Or maybe it’s just a question of whether you have anyone maintaining your business processes and adjusting them as needed to make sure they make sense. If you have an onerous business process for changing your business processes, you are not going to stay out of trouble for long.

Part of the problem is that the people who created the business process are not the same people who use the business process, so they don't realize that the process they created is onerously difficult, or that the instructions which may have been correct at the time they were written have since fallen comically out of date. As a hapless consumer of the process, you have no ability to fill in missing steps or clarify...Read morePart of the problem is that the people who created the business process are not the same people who use the business process, so they don’t realize that the process they created is onerously difficult, or that the instructions which may have been correct at the time they were written have since fallen comically out of date. As a hapless consumer of the process, you have no ability to fill in missing steps or clarify things that are unclear because you don’t know the correct answer! You also don’t have write access to the web server that hosts the instructions, so all you can do is say “Please update the instructions to include this information”, and that’s usually where good ideas go to die because the people who created the business process are busy with other things.

It's an inherent problem with automated systems. In the book "Peopleware", Demarco and Lister have a chapter titled "The Self-Healing System":
"When you automate a previously all-human system it becomes entirely deterministic. The new system is capable of making only those responses planned explicitly by its builders. So the self-healing quality is lost. Any response that will be required must be put there in the first place. If ever the system needs to be healed, that...Read moreIt’s an inherent problem with automated systems. In the book “Peopleware”, Demarco and Lister have a chapter titled “The Self-Healing System”:

So the self-healing quality is lost. Any response that will be required must be put there in the first place. If ever the system needs to be healed, that can only be done outside the context of its operation. Maintainers come in to take the system apart and reconstruct it with one or more new planned responses added.”

This is why you lie... uhh, massage the truth.  No-one actually cares whether your wossname meets the whatsit requirements, they just want to see a ticked checkbox.  For all intents and purposes, no human ever checks any of this stuff, and on the remote chance they do all you'll get is a note to fill the form or whatever out properly in future (my best response was an amused "you've been using this...Read moreThis is why you lie… uhh, massage the truth.

For all intents and purposes, no human ever checks any of this stuff, and on the remote chance they do all you’ll get is a note to fill the form or whatever out properly in future (my best response was an amused “you’ve been using this same no-op response for years, you really should update it at some point”).  I’ve been using this for years for paperwork-production exercises, just invent something plausible and put it in there.
I found this out years ago when I was filling out a form justifying an over-the-limit equipment purchase, because of some glitch in the 3270 (which tells you how long ago it was) the details were never filled out and half the form was left blank.  Nothing ever happened because all that mattered was that the paperwork was filed, not that it contained anything useful.

You might be able to get away with ignoring some processes, but others are harder to weasel out of, such as regulatory compliance. “Failure to complete this process will result in the deactivation of your Widget.”

Every time I have to go through an absolutely "critical and mandatory" process that was kicked off by some automated compliance tool, I can guarantee you my experience has been like I was the very first person to ever attempt it. Completely broken and soul crushing. I used to care about the things it was asking because I was naive and believed it really was critical and mandatory, but I can without a doubt say...Read moreEvery time I have to go through an absolutely “critical and mandatory” process that was kicked off by some automated compliance tool, I can guarantee you my experience has been like I was the very first person to ever attempt it.

Problems with Win16 compatibility? Just wait until everybody’s on Win64, and the problem will solve itself! Win32 problems can be solved this way, too; but please be patient: Win128 still doesn’t have a launch date…

On the subject of useless automated email announcements: my company some time ago changed over to a new defect tracking system, which is awesome.  It works in modernd-day browers and is objectively better to use for searching for defects and collaboration.  But it has the terrible habit of sending out email blasts for EACH change made to a defect.  If I update three related fields in a defect, that's three emails. ...Read moreOn the subject of useless automated email announcements: my company some time ago changed over to a new defect tracking system, which is awesome.  It works in modernd-day browers and is objectively better to use for searching for defects and collaboration.  But it has the terrible habit of sending out email blasts for EACH change made to a defect.  If I update three related fields in a defect, that’s three emails.  Forget about having a daily digest of changes, such as a nightly list of defects updated in the last day; no, that’s not enough email spam for this system.  The result is that all of those emails get shunted to a folder, one that I rarely check, and I’ve spoken with many people on the team who do the same in their own ways.  So we have yet another system for automated emails that get auto-ignored or deleted.

Bonus points if, when you you get to a functioning website, it was written for IE5 and is horribly broken by default in any browser written after, say, 2001.  IE5 compat mode in IE mode within Edge gets you a somewhat functional site, but it fails at the last step, and you lose all of your work in the webform.
