One unrelated question regarding taskbar buttons – why taskbar icon badges are enabled only for large taskbar buttons which are quite unusable on a vertical taskbar due to huge vertical margins (which multiplies with every button)?
Personally, I don’t care much about esthetics, but I care a lot about functionality, which is limited using small taskbar buttons since I miss badge notifications…

I still use Quick Launch instead (which still works as of Windows 10 ver 1809) precisely because I can have a separate SECTION (that I prefer to be close to the clock, not the Start button).

Just like the Brazil Nuts in mixed nuts, they tends to float at the top. (My taskbar is placed vertically)

There are a couple of apps that I have pinned which create a second "instance" of an entry in the taskbar, i.e. the pinned app icon is still on the left side, the currently open app window is a new instance way on the right (so I see the app twice, not grouped as for other apps). I don't know why this is happening and thought you'd answer this behavior here.

“First, observe that new apps go at the end” unless a unrelated instance of said app is already running (Windows 7 and later).
My pet peeve; If I have [Notepad – DevNotes.txt][Visual Studio][Maps] and then open Recipies.txt there is no way to stop it from grouping with the other Notepad instance and there is no setting to go back to the classic Win95..Vista mode without 3rd-party hacks.

Go the taskbar settings and set the “Combine taskbar buttons” options to “never” and enable “use small taskbar buttons” and you get back the classic Win95 mode.
This is how I work and I hope Microsoft never removes the option to use the old-style taskbar.

It will still force all taskbar buttons of the same AppModelId/.exe to be next to each other, you can’t have [Notepad][Calc][Notepad] etc. Replicating the classic style is not possible after Win7 added AppModelIds.

Yeah, I forgot about that.  I end up using one of those “3rd-party hacks” called “7+ taskbar tweaker” to turn off AppID grouping.  I also set middle-click to close an application rather than launch another instance.
