I had the fun of debugging a simpler version of this. I had some code that was written for synchronous handles and using an OVERLAPPED structure on the stack for some other reason, called ReadFile, handled errors, and returned. Of course, ERROR_IO_PENDING was just another error in the default case of the switch statement so it did nothing in particular; and of course I managed at some point to pass an asynchronous handle to it....Read moreI had the fun of debugging a simpler version of this.

Boom stack corruption.

This kind of corruption is particularly hard to find because since this is the kernel updating these structures, enabling pageheap wonâ€™t find these. Same thing with the overlapped reads and misinterpreting the return code of ReadFileEx, I think you mentioned that in a previous post.

This kind of in-depth analysis is so very valuable. I have the same kind of cancellation problem in my code.
