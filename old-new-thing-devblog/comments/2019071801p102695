I think I’m done with bat-and-ball games. Though from watching stoolball videos online, it seems that the game is well-enjoyed by all who participate, so it’s got that going for it.

This seems very similar to the Danish game ‘rundbold’. ‘Rund’ means ’round’ and I believe it refers to how you have to run around the bases. (‘Bold’ is ‘ball’.)
When I was in primary school ‘rundbold’ was the most popular game when we were with a teacher.
