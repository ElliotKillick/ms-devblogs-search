Reminds me of the ValueTask vs Task differences in .net – one you await once only and the other you can await as much as you like (as another commenter said, like the well known JS Promise)

cppcoro::shared_task (github.com/lewissbaker/cppcoro#shared_taskt) looks good to me, though the library doesn’t seem to aim to be production-grade.

In JavaScript you can of course await the same Promise multiple times, and it's really handy to be able to create something asynchronously, so to speak, and then have all the users await the result of the creation. (Less vaguely, the arrangement I'm thinking of is that there's an "asynchronous" lookup function which first of all tries to retrieve a cached Promise, and if one doesn't exist it creates one and asynchronously initialises the object,...Read moreIn JavaScript you can of course await the same Promise multiple times, and it’s really handy to be able to create something asynchronously, so to speak, and then have all the users await the result of the creation. (Less vaguely, the arrangement I’m thinking of is that there’s an “asynchronous” lookup function which first of all tries to retrieve a cached Promise, and if one doesn’t exist it creates one and asynchronously initialises the object, putting the resulting Promise in the cache, returning it for the caller to wait for. The lookup function can’t itself wait for the initialisation of course.)
