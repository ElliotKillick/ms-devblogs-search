Well Spotted @samlhsamlh
100% agree,
static_assert(unconditional_v<Op, bool, false>
should be:
static_assert(unconditional_v<bool, false, Op>
however, overall excellent and helpful submission – thanks for  your valuable and consistent additions to te devblogs @oldnewthing (Raymond Chen)

Hm, unless I’m missing something, I think this line:
static_assert(unconditional_v<Op, bool, false>
should be:
static_assert(unconditional_v<bool, false, Op>
That is, the unused type should be at the end of the template arguments.
