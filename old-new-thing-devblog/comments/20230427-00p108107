Tiny nitpick: According to cppreference, `std::memory_order::consume` and Release-Consume ordering have been around since C++11, although some semantic revisions (and the std::memory_order_consume alias) were added with C++20.

If your compiler predates C++20, however, the consume memory order is almost certainly treated as acquire (legal, just not faster). C++17 temporarily discouraged the use of the consume order because the semantics were impossible to use correctly, and thus all compilers were implementing it as acquire.
The revisions in C++20 took some very smart people a lot of effort, and changed the definitions subtly so that you can use consume and get weaker memory ordering than...Read moreIf your compiler predates C++20, however, the consume memory order is almost certainly treated as acquire (legal, just not faster).
