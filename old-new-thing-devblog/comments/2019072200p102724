The only time I set foot on Microsoft campus was when I interviewed for a job there in 2003 (which I did not get). There was some material there referring to the next Windows Server. I asked if that was "Blackcomb" and was told it was not. I found this curious because at the time the official story was that "Longhorn" would only be a client OS and "Blackcomb" would still be the next server...Read moreThe only time I set foot on Microsoft campus was when I interviewed for a job there in 2003 (which I did not get).

I found this curious because at the time the official story was that “Longhorn” would only be a client OS and “Blackcomb” would still be the next server release. They said that “Longhorn Server” was indeed a thing. I was pretty excited to have this bit of insider information, despite it not really affecting me in any way. I don’t remember when the existence of “Longhorn Server” was officially announced. 
As for Windows 7, I remember some confusion about what the codename was with Vienna/Seven (splled out) often being reported together.
Random chatter: Windows ME also had a codeename similar to its final release name (Milennium vs Milennium Edition)

Windows Server 2008 (Longhorn Server) was not released at the same time as Windows Vista RTM. Just like Windows Server 2003/XP x64 and Windows XP x86, but different. Windows Server 2008 SP1 was the first public non-beta version and released at the same time as Windows Vista SP1. This way Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista were build from the same code branches, unlike Windows XP x86 and Windows Server 2003/XP x64.

However Microsoft did ran her website on Windows Server 2008 before SP1, and if I recall correctly so did a few Microsoft partners like Dell.

Of course, early in-development releases of Windows 7 had the beautiful branding of ‘Windows (R) Code Name “Windows 7″‘.

“Blackcomb”? 🤷‍♀️ The majority of news outlets report “Vienna” to be Windows 7’s codename. Apparently, someone called Robert Scoble, who worked as an “evangelist” for Microsoft, said it.
Also, not sure what “Träumerei” or “Gaspard de la nuit” are. Never heard of Ravel or Brahms before either. Quite frankly, I know as much about music terminology as Beethoven knew about the -Recipe switch of Add-WindowsCapability in PowerShell.

There was usually a codename for the version after the one that you were currently working on, so things could be postponed to that future version. So Blackcomb was originally the version after Whistler, but Longhorn got put into the middle. As that stretched on, the plans for Blackcomb were no longer meaningful. So the next version got a new codename, Vienna. By the time Longhorn was wrapping up and planning began for the next...Read moreThere was usually a codename for the version after the one that you were currently working on, so things could be postponed to that future version.

Still the best version of Windows ever 🙂

How much of the Blackcomb plans have since happened or are planned, or in the works now?

Kinda reminds me of Cairo…

Yeah, Cairo and Longhorn had some really promising technology incubating.  But Cairo gave way to Chicago (which was pretty good IMO), while Longhorn gave way to, well, Vista (I still have a bad memory of a hidden Xbox admin account on my machine causing UAC locking me out of damn near everything….I had to email my SAM file to someone @microsoft to unlock it!)

Now Raymond will have to correct this, but the rumors I heard:Cairo - So named because the ideas suggested for it were "exotic".Chicago - Because an early demo was at a conference in Chicago, later retrofitted as "just that far to Cairo" (i.e, as Seattle to Chicago is about 1/5th the distance Seattle to Cairo,  win3 to w95 would be 1/5 the changes of win3 to Cairo)Memphis (win98a as a recall), mostly a media/audio updates,...Read moreNow Raymond will have to correct this, but the rumors I heard:Cairo – So named because the ideas suggested for it were “exotic”.Chicago – Because an early demo was at a conference in Chicago, later retrofitted as “just that far to Cairo” (i.e, as Seattle to Chicago is about 1/5th the distance Seattle to Cairo,  win3 to w95 would be 1/5 the changes of win3 to Cairo)Memphis (win98a as a recall), mostly a media/audio updates, but I like the idea of it be “old world Cairo”.

Now you’ve got me curious if the code name for Windows 10 was “Windows 9”.
Also, is “Blackbomb” an intentionally derrogatory term that was used internally, or is that just a typo for “Blackcomb”?

Oops, typo. But now that you made a joke out of it, I can’t just fix it or the joke won’t make sense. Eh, I fixed it. People will figure out the joke. (By the way, the code name for Windows 10 was “Threshold”.)

This is what I explain to people:
Windows Vista was version 6.0
Windows 7 was 6.1 => 6 + 1 = 7
Windows 8 was 6.2 => 6 + 2 = 8
Windows 8.1 was 6.3 => 8 + 1 = 9 and 6.3 = 9
That makes Windows 10 the logical successor to Windows 8.1 and 1 + 0 = 1 => There will be only one Windows version forever
