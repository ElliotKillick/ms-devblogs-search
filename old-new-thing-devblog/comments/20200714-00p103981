* Test1 and Test2 are identical; I think you meant to omit the noexcept in Test1.
* You have a note that says you didn’t check icc, right after describing the behavior of icc.
* IsNoexcept is useful, but Pointer should retain the noexcept specifier, matching the template argument exactly.

Don’t forget the ‘abominable’ complication. (And the Windows-specific calling convention complication)

These templates deconstruct function pointer types, not function types. Does C++ now allow abominable function pointer types?
Ugh, the extern "C" vs. extern "C++" complication now that language linkage is part of the function type.
