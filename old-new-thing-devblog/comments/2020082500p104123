I like the lesson here! When you get off the plane you‚Äôre often smelly, hungry, and thirsty.

Raymond, I would be very surprised if Bill Gates shared the sentiment you expressed at the bottom of your post.  It also may show cultural differences between countries.  In Australia, we wouldn‚Äôt really accept that an employee should be expected to carry money to procure favours for his boss.

I remember that the boss of my second job nearly always don't bring enough CNY cash when he goes to China, so on lots of the time when my supervisor travel with him, he borrows money from my supervisor to pay the restaurant bills (and that's before credit card is a commonly accepted payment method in China). And on one occasion that I travel with them, my supervisor rant to me about this, and wonder...Read moreI remember that the boss of my second job nearly always don‚Äôt bring enough CNY cash when he goes to China, so on lots of the time when my supervisor travel with him, he borrows money from my supervisor to pay the restaurant bills (and that‚Äôs before credit card is a commonly accepted payment method in China).

So yeah, maybe ‚ÄúAlways be prepared when you are [del]called upon to pick up[/del][add]travelling with[/add] an executive‚Äù is universal.

I dont get it. If he is so found of hamburgers but never carry cash and the joints dont take card, does he make the burgers himself, carry around a person with cash, carry around a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù with cash or expecting he is famous will get him free burgers?

And these people didn‚Äôt carry credit cards either?
What if he needed a tie instead of a burger?

Thought the same thing.
I was expecting Bill to carry some special version of AmEx or some other card given to billionaires only.

McDonalds didn‚Äôt accept credit cards until the early 2000‚Äôs.  So if Bill was going to pay for his hamburger with an AMEX in the 90‚Äôs, he would first need that time machine Raymond talks about.

Wow, I did not know that.
It seems like they really did not start taking credit cards until 2004: https://www.chiefmarketer.com/mcdonalds-accepts-credit-cards/
That is really unexpected.

Yeah, the ubiquity of being able to pay for anything anywhere with a payment card (or phone that‚Äôs emulating the payment card NFC protocol) is a really recent thing.

Bill should have travelled to Australia :)
We've had good point-of-sale use of debit & credit cards easily back in the 90s.  I haven't swiped my credit card probably since 2004 or earlier too - chip & PIN for quite a number of years, and for probably the last decade it's just tap (and PIN if >$100, or >$200 since COVID and the desire to reduce keypad touches)
I find it mind boggling how...Read moreBill should have travelled to Australia üôÇ

"This experience taught a valuable lesson: Always be prepared when you are called upon to pick up an executive"
What a crock. The actual lesson here: if you're an executive and there's a chance you might want your lackey to swing by McDonald's drive-through on the way to a meeting, bring your own damn money.
It should not be anyone's job description to pay for meals for their boss.
Who knows if Bill Gates ever learned his lesson...Read more‚ÄúThis experience taught a valuable lesson: Always be prepared when you are called upon to pick up an executive‚Äù

I don‚Äôt think the expectation is for the employee to pay out of pocket for the boss‚Äô meal. That‚Äôs what travel expense allowances are for.
In fact when I travel with my boss, I often pay for the group meals on my card ‚Äì because I only need 1 level of management approval, and my boss is sure to approve the expense report.

Many companies' policies forbid lower ranking employees from paying for higher ranking employees for just that reason - that the expense is approved by someone who benefited from the expense.
