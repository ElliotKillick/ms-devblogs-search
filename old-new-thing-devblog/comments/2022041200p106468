Unfortunately the “Trusted Platform Module” is the very thing we don’t trust about Windows 11. Everyone’s saying it’s just a covert mechanism of allowing “woke” companies to effectively blacklist and hardware-ban people from the internet. I’m no expert on security theater but the very hint of such a possibility has a chilling effect on anyone’s desire to upgrade.

The only flaw with that idea is the whole self build/system integration market where they use off the shelf components.
As an example, my system's mother board has a firmware TPM with a hardware TPM header. What does that mean? I can go to a retailer that sells them, spend £18 and get a completely new TPM by tomorrow using next day delivery. This means that people who have systems with hardware TPM headers (which...Read moreThe only flaw with that idea is the whole self build/system integration market where they use off the shelf components.

I can go to a retailer that sells them, spend £18 and get a completely new TPM by tomorrow using next day delivery. This means that people who have systems with hardware TPM headers (which is widespread), can just bypass any kind of TPM based hardware ban (if that is even possible) by spending a little money.
So this feels like a terrible system that the computer savvy people could get around easily.

Yeah, you wish!
Your brilliant hacking stunt is missing an important step. You must magically teleport the correct cryptographic keys onto the new TPM. Even if you accomplish this magical feat, you'll end up with a computer that behaves exactly as before, i.e., it is no less and no more secure. So, before you come up with such spectacular hacking schemes, maybe think about what you want to accomplish.

Eh? What? I am wondering if your reading comprehension failed you there or if you just completely failed to understand the general concept.
So, let's put this into simple points.
1) OP was talking about hardware banning a computer from the internet based upon the TPM in the system.
2) I mentioned that someone who owned a system with a motherboard with a hardware TPM header could easily get around this by simply replacing the TPM...Read moreEh? What?

2) I mentioned that someone who owned a system with a motherboard with a hardware TPM header could easily get around this by simply replacing the TPM in the system.
Implication of 2) This is talking about a system that you own, so you have access to the recovery keys hence getting the TPM into a state that can boot Windows is trivial.
What 2) doesn’t say is that this is security related, this is only talking about why using a TPM as some method to hardware ban someone from the internet is not feasible. Hence I find it obvious that this doesn’t change how secure a system is.
Finally, I am much closer to get the off my lawn age.

“Everyone’s saying”, “woke” companies”, “ban people from the internet”…
Gross. Can’t we have at least one blog on the internet not polluted with MAGA baloney?

One, The TPM has been around for a while now. 10 can use the TPM as well, this isn’t a 11 thing
Two, believe me if hardware companies wanted to keep you from doing something they have way more powerful and low level ways than just fiddling with a TPM

Technically you don’t need to take ownership of the TPM to use BitLocker on Windows 10. (Changed from Windows 7.) There’s very little reason not to though.

The ID is a bunch of letters, digits, and dashes inside curly braces.
I love how Raymond sounds completely different to programmers and IT workers, though I’d expect a technician to know what UUIDs look like (they’re used in GPT).

I would like to introduce to you the concept of a “joke”. Raymond is employing this concept.

OP was correct. I know that this article is going to be found by non-technical people, so I adjusted my writing to suit the audience.

Sometimes, the TPM doesn’t play friendly, and I have to enter my 48-digit BitLocker key (ugh). I don’t know why this happens.
This happens in older systems. Two things can help: (1) Pay attention to what devices are connected at the time this happens. You might discover that connecting certain devices triggers the unfriendliness. (2) There is an optional Microsoft patch that helps with this. Try searching "Attestation criterion 5." (I couldn't find it. Maybe...Read moreSometimes, the TPM doesn’t play friendly, and I have to enter my 48-digit BitLocker key (ugh). I don’t know why this happens.
