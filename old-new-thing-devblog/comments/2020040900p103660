I used to solve these UI -> background thread -> UI reentrancy loops with MsgWaitForMultipleObjects.
Hint: block closing your window for the duration.

Not sure what you mean by “block closing your window”. Did you mean “alert the user that this will cancel a background task”?

If the window that handled the message (and I’m pretty sure raised except for possibly WM_COMMAND) is destroyed while in the MsgWaitForMultipleObjects message pump, you’ve got stack corruption. Block close window.
