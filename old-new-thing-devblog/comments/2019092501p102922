The only time I would queue is at opening time, after that youâ€™re just being punished for your lateness.
I try to be pretty organised, so that I know when things are busy. I learnt from Disney Worldâ€¦.

I feel fortunate that, when my wife and I visited the Louvre years ago, there was no line to see the Mona Lisa.  There was a crush of people around it, of course, and guards were hovering nearby, but we had only a short wait to get to the front of the crowd, maybe 5 minutes.

There was a crush of people around it, of course, and guards were hovering nearby, but we had only a short wait to get to the front of the crowd, maybe 5 minutes.  It really is a beguiling and captivating work of art, especially for itâ€™s size.  It absolutely is worth it to see his painting in person if the line is not long.  Thereâ€™s something about it that does not come across in a photograph.
We spent a whole day in the Louvre and saw a great many works of art.  Aside from small-ish crowds around the Lisa and the Venus de Milo, we never stood in excessively long queues.  We may have eaten at the same cafe as Raymond, though there werenâ€™t any temporary constructions around it at the time.  When you get away from the marquee works you can find yourself nearly alone with the art (aside from security and cameras, of course).
I recommend the Paris museum pass for the Louvre, Versailles, and many other museums in the city.  With it you get to skip most lines (if memory serves, itâ€™s not accept at the Eiffel tower, but is accepted nearly everywhere else).  Most lines are not to get into the museum but rather to buy tickets to get in; with the pass, you already have your ticket, so just walk up to the entrance, show the pass, and youâ€™re in.  Youâ€™ll get much more time to enjoy the museum; however, one day is not enough to see everything.  Budget 2 days if you want to see itâ€™s whole collection (or if the lines are excessive as described by Raymond).

Note the genuine Angelina is not in the Louvre, but not far from it: https://angelina-paris.fr/en/226-rue-de-rivoli but you will have to queue too. Next time you come, Iâ€™ll offer a personal unique custom tour of Paris for some inner details on how the Shell works ðŸ™‚

The Mona Lisa isnâ€™t worth the normal lines either in my book. At least not for the novice.
There are so much more interesting things in the Louvre like the codex of Hammurabi where thereâ€™s virtually nobody â€“ certainly no queue.

The Mona Lisa should be moved to a new museum outside of the Louvre.
It should be in a new museum dedicated to it; something with a really cool architecture and with a conveyor belt so that people donâ€™t spend time in front of it.
A little bit like the Crown Jewels in London.
