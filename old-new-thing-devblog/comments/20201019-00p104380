If you want to see which volume guid is which, you can use MountVol:
> mountvol C: /L
    \\?\Volume{901c71df-e058-4f09-930a-23670e92a165}\
And yes, you can mount a VHD(x) or a WIM using dism. It‚Äôs useful for offline installation of stuff before starting VMs.
Also, some RAID controllers can present multiple RAID disks as a single ‚Äúphysical disk‚Äù.

I've never used anything fancier than multiple drive letters because things get complex and messy very quickly. Specifically, many programs don't properly support things like NTFS mount points, so doing something as simple as checking used/free space becomes an exercise in manual bookkeeping. üòï

As Nick of Science Asylum would say, It's okay to be a little bit crazy. üòÄ

Just to make things look crazier, since Win2003 you can have DFS volume that has multiple mountpoints (looks like subfolders) mounting on different file servers.

Or you can get even more creative and load a VHDX as a physical drive from a physical drive so that you can mount while you mount

Well, that‚Äôs how you try out new Windows system if you have plenty of space on your existing hard disk but don‚Äôt want to create another partition.

Both the drive letter and the volume{GUID} names are just symbolic links to the real mount point (device object) in the NT object tree which you can see if you look for them with Sysinternal‚Äôs Object Viewer tool.

I‚Äôm pretty sure the volume Windows is installed in has to be mounted with a drive letter. Everything else can be mounted as c:\cdrom etc.
