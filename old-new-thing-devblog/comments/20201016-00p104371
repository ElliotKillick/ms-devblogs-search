Same typo as in Wednesday’s table? Shouldn’t it be:
auto& hidden = kvp;
decltype(auto) key = hidden.Key();
decltype(auto) value = hidden.Value();

My best guess, is that the auto& hidden extends the lifetime of kvp in case it is a temporary.  Disclaimer: I am no C++ language lawyer and it has been 8 years or so since I used C++ on a daily basis.  (Or it could be a typo)
