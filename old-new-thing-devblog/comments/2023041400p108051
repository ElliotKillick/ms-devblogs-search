This looks like something that can easily be googled.  Indeed, the Microsoft Docs page of CreateFromWICBitmap shows up as the literal first result when googling the keywords windows.graphics.imaging.softwarebitmap iwicbitmap. I guess the mini-series is intended to showcase the multiple ways you can create a SoftwareBitmap, but it still feels a bit silly.

The documentation somewhat misleadingly says “Creates an *ISoftwareBitmapNative* from the provided IWICBitmap.” So you’ll read the description and say, “That’s not what I want. I want a SoftwareBitmap, not an ISoftwareBitmapNative.” Believe it or not, this sequence was based on an actual customer asking how to create a SoftwareBitmap and trying out all sorts of things without ever considering CreateFromWICBitmap. Sorry you didn’t enjoy the trip.

Yeah, I reckon Raymond is running out of material.  Telling us three ways not to do something, before telling us the obviously best way, fills a lot more pages.

Or there is a much simpler and logical explanation.
For example, suppose you don’t get the bitmap through WIC, how would you load it? This series showed the other ways of loading information into a bitmap.
