On the topic of copy/pasting, does anyone know why the selection behaviour when double clicking a word in a Windows text box always includes the whitespace after the word, rather than just the word itself?  This really bugs me!
I know there will be some obscure software that depends on this behaviour, but I wish there was a setting to exclude the whitespace.

I don‚Äôt have an answer to your question, but you can easily get rid of the space while selecting by double-clicking the word and moving the cursor to the right while still holding the button down. You can also select multiple words by doing the same thing, just moving to the last word (or special character) you want to select before releasing the button.

That‚Äôs genius, I had no idea you could hold the mouse button down after a double click!  I‚Äôll definitely be using that trick going forward, thanks Ed üôÇ

No problem! I wish someone had told me about this too :)
You can similarly select entire paragraphs at a time by triple-clicking any part of the paragraph and dragging the cursor around.
If you'd like to know about another obscure text selection trick: To select larger portions of text, there's a much easier way than holding down the left button and dragging the cursor around.

You can simply left-click the portion of the text just before the first character you want to select, then hold Shift and click just after the last character. If you want to change your selection, you can keep holding Shift and clicking (or dragging) until you get it right.
By the way, quite a few of the tricks I know I learned completely by accident. It‚Äôs funny how many years, decades we let go by oblivious to these amazingly simple yet headache-saving tools. This reminded me to do something I‚Äôve always thought about but keep forgetting: search for a compilation with more such tricks!

The bonus reading also explains why SetClipboardData does not change the ownership to the hwnd (‚Äúcurrent opener‚Äù) passed into the last successful call to OpenClipboard ‚Äî during WM_RENDERFORMAT, the current opener is the window requesting data, and the owner should still be the window rendering the data, which calls SetClipboardData.

It would be more neat if there could be multiple clipboard owners and each of them associated with their clipboard data.
What‚Äôs the use of ‚Äúclipboard owner‚Äù except in the ‚Äúdelayed rendering‚Äù scenario or to perform check on the ‚Äúprocess integrity level‚Äù? Seems these all are related to the clipboard data themselves instead of the clipboard as a whole.

Under what valid conditions can data from multiple owners be on the clipboard simultaneously? It‚Äôs supposed to be cleared every time you copy something new, and you can only copy from one window at a time.
