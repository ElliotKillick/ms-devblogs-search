If it is the only atomic instruction and nobody uses it how do you construct locks? Do you just never have DMA or multiprocessing of any kind?

The SH-3 is from the mid-90s and targeted at embedded applications. I don't think it has any SMP support. (For that matter, I don't think the versions of Windows CE that ran on it had SMP support either.)
IO with peripherals that have DMA capability usually has explicit hand-offs of some kind or other, not locks in shared memory.

IO with peripherals that have DMA capability usually has explicit hand-offs of some kind or other, not locks in shared memory. And between processes or threads, you don’t need hardware-level atomic operations on a single-processor system, just some way of guaranteeing that the scheduler doesn’t context-switch out of a thread at the wrong time. There are several ways of accomplishing this but the important part is that the OS can do it by itself.
