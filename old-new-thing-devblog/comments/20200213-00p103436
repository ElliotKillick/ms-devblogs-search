Why does the update need to include the reverse patch at all? Wouldn’t the client be able to construct it by itself?

In theory, you could make the client calculate the reverse patch, but that would slow down the update process because calculating an efficient reverse patch can be very CPU-intensive. We’ll see more about this later.

Ah, we finally know what the “this Cumulative Update does not include any new code and is designed to help us test our servicing pipeline” stuff in all the recent WIP new build blogposts is about.

In other words, Quality updates are a good upgrade from what there was before.

(Note that your Express link uses http: instead of https: like the Full and Delta links do. This triggered me because it didn’t show up as visited in my feed reader…)

How about the time required for installing the updates on the client side? I would imagine that patching a large number of files twice might take a significant longer time than simply applying a full update, i.e. overwriting all files. Or in other words: Compared to other operating systems that tend to apply full updates, I find Windows client updates to take quite some time for installation…

It's a tradeoff between bandwidth and execution time, and enough paying customers are still bandwidth-constrained enough that solutions are important, especially with more sites working entirely off mobile. Of course, Microsoft now also releases a straight full update without patches every six months, which also keeps the patches from accumulating to the ludicrous numbers that XP's and 7's did.

Of course, Microsoft now also releases a straight full update without patches every six months, which also keeps the patches from accumulating to the ludicrous numbers that XP’s and 7’s did. Not sure why the rollup concept was so rarely used, instead of a quarterly thing from the beginning (except, again, perhaps bandwidth).

When cumulative updates were introduced, there was much consternation from users who lost the ability to pick and choose which updates to install. It won't take much work to find people who declared the loss of "pick and choose" the end of the world. This guy even called it communist.

With my mathematician’s hat on, I’d call this “reducing to an earlier problem”. Rather than write lots of proofs for tiny differences in starting point, you transform each problem into a known, already solved, version – on the assumption that transformation is much easier than the proof itself.

What does a mathematician do when they see a house NOT on fire? First, set fire to it, thus reducing it to an earlier problem.

I knew the new updates were all cumulative, but doesn’t “quality” in a monthly cumulative update refer to it including non-security bug fixes (hotfix content), as opposed to the “security-only” updates?

Does this mean now hexpatching Windows files will completely prevent Quality Update from functioning (and leave only Full Update)?

I thought hexpatching Windows files wasn’t even possible thanks to the fact that every binary that Microsoft ships these days is digitally signed.

Default configurations of Windows don’t stop unsigned or invalidly signed userland code from running.  Try it yourself; modify a byte in Notepad, or something, and try to run it.
There are policy configurations you can use to enforce signing, I believe, but having those on by default would break so much stuff it’s not even funny.

It would depend on where your hex edits are. If you edit something that hasn’t been modified since the original version, it would keep your changes (with potentially-dangerous results). If you edit something that’s been modified, it would overwrite the changes (I think). If your edits straddle changed and unchanged sections, they’d be partially-undone. If you change the size of the file, it would probably trash everything.

And if you changed something that wasn’t itself modified, but the patch said “Copy bytes X through Y to location Z, but add 2 to the second byte”, then things get even weirder.

Before any of these happens, CBS checks the file’s cryptographic hash to confirm rollback safety. If the check fails, the file is marked as corrupt. During the Windows maintenance schedule, CBS will repair the corruption. If necessary, it will download a copy from Microsoft’s CDN server.
Of course, none of this is bulletproof.

I thought Windows was doing that since long ago. Or was it Office?

Turns out update uninstallers are there and they are needed because before installing a new update you have to uninstall the current one to bring the product to the appropriate baseline (uninstall a CU to get back to the latest Service Pack to install the newest CU for example).
I’m starting to think it was Office (SharePoint to be exact). Same update model?

Most MSI update servicing is either full installs, a series of small MSP patches laid on top of each other, like the Express update model, or a cached full installer at major versions and caching new full patches while removing the old, akin to Quality updates. But that's all up to the developer to pick and implement the model they want.

But that’s all up to the developer to pick and implement the model they want.
Deleting the Installer folder is a whole other thing, though, since you’ve also deleted all of the install/update/uninstall directions for everything, instead of just the attached files, with a tool like Orca — that might break updates, but at least not uninstall. MSI caching and servicing in general is a major pain point, especially on space-constrained systems, but the flexibility of Windows Installer is such that Microsoft doesn’t really have much room to dictate what can and can’t be done, let alone help users clean it up. (Or help users cache installers that don’t cache themselves, which is even worse when it asks for the original during an update two years later.)

No, a very different update model.
The Windows Component Based Servicing (CBS) model is governed by DISM and XML files. There are no .msi files involved. The thing that Windows was doing since long ago was storing multiple versions of the file in WinSxS.
Of course what this meant was that people were deleting the WinSxS directory because it was too big and apparently useless and they were breaking their systems that way.

Update Formats Week was interesting. I wonder if there's anything for Friday, or if we're back to regular posts.
How is the tradeoff in CPU usage between Express and Quality updates? The Express updates have to do the inventory, but the Quality updates have to apply more patches.

It’s a little disappointing that the Quality updates are so much larger for the client than the Express updates. I understand that it really improves things on the server side, but it feels like a step back in terms of network usage.

On the other hand, the Quality update works much better with network caching. If you're updating 1000 machines in a corporate network, you can set up a caching proxy and everybody gets a 100% cache hit. Even on personal networks, you get this benefit if you have more than one machine, since the second machine can get the update from the first machine, even if they have different starting points.

On personal network, if you have more than 1 Win10 PC, you can also be benefited when “PCs from my local network” source in “Windows Update settings” is selected too.
