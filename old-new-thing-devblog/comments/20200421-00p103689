is that possible that UWP apps do get suspended when they’re not on the active virtual desktop  How is it ?

It can bring some performance improvements for applications which constantly update their windows (at least, if they are well behaved and use RedrawWindow() and WM_PAINT to do that). But the same improvements could come of minimizing them, for example, so this is nothing exclusive of virtual desktops.

I thought that UWP apps would be suspended when the virtual desktop they were part of became inactive? Similar to when you lock the desktop?

UWP apps do get suspended when they’re not on the active virtual desktop. That’s not a feature of virtual desktop, but a feature of UWP (or UWP lifecycle manager).

Yes, I’d also thought it was equivalent in this respect to minimizing an app’s windows in desktop mode, or switching away from it in tablet mode. Is this not true anymore? Was it ever true?

“And unless the program has been updated to understand virtual desktops”
I would assume UWP knows about virtual desktops
