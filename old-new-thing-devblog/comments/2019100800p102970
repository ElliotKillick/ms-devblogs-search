On the other hand, when one of my ex-company expand to the adjacent room in the building, I got the privilege to use sledgehammer to knock off the wall between the rooms.
And my boss enjoyed that experience very much.

Will the product Walk of Fame be preserved somewhere building 16-17? I was there ten years ago, and building 18 looked like 80s.

It’s still there. The 16/17/18 buildings aren’t being demolished.
