I just used WS_EX_CONTROL­PARENT to join a nested dialog into a parent one.
The tab order works great, alt keys work as well.
However, buttons in the nested dialog now don’t respond to the Enter Key. (when the tab focus is on them)
Without WS_EX_CONTROL­PARENT they respond correctly.
Hitting the Space bar on the button does work, enter does not.
How to address that?

A third-party GUI builder I used to use would automatically create both an outer parent control that contained the tab control plus all of the panes as separate nested dialogs, which also allowed you to think of the entire tab control as its own window as well.

Huh, that goes against everything I’ve ever experienced?
I always thought the tab order going hierarchically down the tree of controls.
The samples also show creating the window inside the tab control (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/Controls/create-a-tab-control-in-the-main-window)
Also, Windows.Forms also has TabPages inside the TabControl. As far as I feel Windows.Forms is a mostly thin layer upon Win32.

In the "How to Create a Tab Control in the Main Window" sample, the child window of the tab control is a static control, so it would not receive the focus; and the tab control is not in a dialog box, so nobody calls IsDialogMessage and keyboard navigation won't work anyway. It is somewhat misleading, though.

Windows Forms appears to implement keyboard navigation on its own, in ContainerControl.ProcessDialogKey.

Why does WS_EX_CONTROL­PARENT block the ability to join the tab order? You can already toggle that with WS_TABSTOP. It would just go: “Whatever” -> Container ->First child.
