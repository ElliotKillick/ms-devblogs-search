‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a tribute to the success of the new version that everybody has forgotten that there was an old and busted version to begin with.‚ÄùThose of us who had to use it haven‚Äôt forgotten. üòâ

I‚Äôm curious about the need for a clean-room reimplementation ‚Äì Microsoft did license Unix in the form of Xenix, couldn‚Äôt they have based it on make from that?

There are three potential possibilities that I can think of: 1. The licence didn‚Äôt allow for Microsoft to use UNIX software outside of its Xenix distribution; 2. The code was too UNIX-centric and would take longer to port than to rewrite; and 3. Microsoft made its `make` tool prior to Xenix being in the picture. Of course, the actual reason is likely something completely different!

We can rule 3. out right away - first version of Xenix was in 1980 so it definitely existed by the late 1980's.
2., the source for make from Unix V7 which Xenix was based on in available at¬†https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/tree/Research-V7/usr/src/cmd/make. At a glance it doesn't seems like there's much unix specfic to it. Maybe a bit of work to replace the fork/waitpid/exec stuff in dosys.c.

There is an old and venerable tradition of ‚Äúno standard or clause in a standard has a divine right of existence‚Äù approach to writing software. Why get it right the first time if you can write it slightly wrong and maybe fix later?
