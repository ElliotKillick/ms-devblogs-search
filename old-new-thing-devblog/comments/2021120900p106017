I wonder if contoso.h even supports using windows.h in Unicode mode.  In my opinion the more robust solution is to always use the W-suffixed function names and explicit wchar_t-based type names (à la C++/WinRT).  There should also be a supercharged version of NOMINMAX that disables all redirection macros.

Believe it or not you can't get rid of all the redirection macros, unfortunately there is a bug (feature?) in quite a few APIs that have symbols identical to GDI names (ex: ID2D1RenderTarget::DrawText collides with GDI DrawText) Such that the actual name in the vtable is actually  so if you try to compile this without redirection macros enabled you end up with symbol errors unfortunately... I've tried because it annoyed me.

I’m fairly sure there are other examples of where redirection macros stomp on other symbol names but this is one I know about.
