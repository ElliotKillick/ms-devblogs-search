There is a different way to implement the validation step: Instead of a boolean constant in the traits class, have a member function. In the trait for optional interface, the function is a no-op. In the trait for required interface, it throws if the hresult is a failure. Call that as (multiqi_traits<Interfaces>::validate(mqi[Ints]), ...). This sidesteps the issue of wrapping an if statement in an immediately-invoked lambda.
