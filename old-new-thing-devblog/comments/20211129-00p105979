I have wondered why SwitchToThisWindow existed ever since I found out about its existence. This explains it. (I am assuming here that it was also used to handle the Alt+Esc key sequence, which was tricky to implement using the then documented API.)

So true. I remember feeling quite shocked when I found out how complex the VMM and VxD layers in Windows 3.1 were - and how 16-bit "Windows", the API I coded to back in the dim and distant, was really just a single client of a multi-tasking 32 bit OS. We all knew about MS-DOS and we all knew about Windows. Hardly any of us knew about the VMM - possibly the most hidden, misunderstood...Read moreSo true.

(Now of course, the crown of concealment is worn by all those Minix instances running in Intel’s “management” cores).

Can’t the call to PostMessage be made in the execution context of the Windows VM?

File as another example under “20th century solved problem which became unsolved in 21st century”. Oh, how I wish I could seamlessly Alt+Tab between windows within Remote Desktop sessions and local…

Published apps?? Works well and gives you what you want.
One setting I *always* configure is the option to apply keyboard shortcuts on the remote desktop even when not full screen.
I wish mstsc, and third party remote support tools like (name redacted - think "co-worker observer") had an option to toggle on or off the redirection of the clipboard during an active session.

I wish mstsc, and third party remote support tools like (name redacted – think “co-worker observer”) had an option to toggle on or off the redirection of the clipboard during an active session. I often want it directed, but if I’m multitasking then I don’t want password manager clipboard use leaking to the remote machine. Similarly if I, as product support, am remote sharing with an IT support person, they may use their password manager to grab a password to the clipboard to configure in some service whilst I shadow their screen – I don’t need or want that password leaking back to me.
