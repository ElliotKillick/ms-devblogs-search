Validation issues like this are fun!  I remember once, in the late 90s, a friend got locked out of her Hotmail account and couldn't get back in even after a password reset.  She asked me to take a look at it, and after a bit of checking, I realized that the temporary password Hotmail assigned in the password reset process did not meet the system's password guidelines!

I can’t prove that that was what was causing it to not let her log in, but after I (somehow; don’t remember the details) got it to reset the password to something new that did meet the guidelines, she was able to log in just fine.

Me personal domain name ends in .us, not .com.  At the time I set it up, .us had been a ccTLD since the beginning of the internet addressing scheme a decade previously. It was astonishing how many website email address validators even into the late 2000s refused to accept that a 2-character TLD was legal.  I eventually got a freebie yahoo.com email just to satisfy those all to frequent ignorant websites.

Yeah, .ca .uk .au .de .jp .hk all those newfangled two-letter TLDs that have existed since the dawn of (dns) time.
I once filled in a survey of “when did you first use the internet?” and it refused to let me truthfully enter “1985”.

What is the final resolution? Increase the width of that field, or ask for new shortened email alias on behalf of that team?
Normally I would think the first one is the way to go, but applying for shorter version of group email address have potential to solve possible problem on other systems.

The full email or the part before the “@”? 20 characters is the limit for SamAccountName, so maybe the tool was using [SamAccountName]@[domain] to pull the user data from LDAP.

Your page “one way to make sure nobody sends you feedback” appears to have gotten corrupted by one of the blog moves. A URL of http://blogs.msdn.commailto:abcdf looks anachronistic.
