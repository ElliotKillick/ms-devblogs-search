I remember this bug/feature, we used to do it at school! Was a fun little trick making a note loop the loop around the screen as if by magic for people. Never caused a crash, but I guess people pushed it as far as it could go.

I wish I could undo every accidental window move or resize. (If my mouse button is still down then I press Escape to try to cancel it, but that doesn’t work everywhere.)

“there was a big field …” => “there was a bug filed…”
I was thinking “I had seen this somewhere else, but where?” until I scrolled down to the One Dev Question video.

This is just a “big” in the first sentence, so cool it’s unfixable!!!

Do you know who found this bug? (Quite possibly not, given that it was “long ago”.)
Could it have been a testing tool that gives random inputs? An end-user mucking around? Someone making a deduction from the fact that so much undo history is stored?

Possibly one of the staffs in Microsoft? I think Outlook was one of the applications they dogfood as they were using Exchange as well.
