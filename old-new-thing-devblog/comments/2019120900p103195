One thing that is totally not obvious what this magic "winrt::fire_and_forget" type is. Replacing it with void reports a really weird compiler error (well, it's weird if you don't know how coroutines work, and that is, I assume, the target reader of this post, like me): "error C2039: 'promise_type': is not a member of 'std::experimental::coroutine_traits'". Looking at "struct coroutine_traits" specialization reveals there's quite a bit of stuff in there.

I should have spelled out the prerequisites: I’m assuming you are already familiar with how to use coroutines and co_await but you want to write your own awaitable types. The winrt::fire_and_forget is what makes the function a coroutine.

As someone who knows the nuts and bolts of the . NET implementation reasonably well, I’m looking forward to seeing the differences between it and the c++ implementation.
