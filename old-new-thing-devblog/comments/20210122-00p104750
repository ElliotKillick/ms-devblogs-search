I can understand the temptation to call TerminateThread if you know it’s going to consume resources unnecessarily for an indefinite period. The proper solution is always periodically checking for a cancel and not using a library that doesn’t, but sometimes mistakes happen, and compounding them may seem like the only option.

Perhaps this logic should be wrapped up in a system provided function or perhaps support for asynchronous calls along the lines of IAsync from WinRT.
