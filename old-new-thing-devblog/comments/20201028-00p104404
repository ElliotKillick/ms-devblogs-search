Does the “fast ABI” change the relative costs of the alternatives?

Are you allowed to change the default down the road if the interface is still compatible?
In classic COM, ISomething2 would generally implement the same methods as ISomething with new methods at the end and ISomething and ISomething2 would share the same vtable. The caller would not know nor care that the ISomething they asked for is actually a ISomething2.

COM is underneath all this, and COM is still COM, so all of the same ABI rules apply.

According to Introduction to Microsoft Interface Definition Language 3.0, “Every interface type directly derives from the Windows Runtime IInspectable interface.” This makes it unlikely that ISomething and ISomething2 could share a vtable if they are Windows Runtime interfaces.
