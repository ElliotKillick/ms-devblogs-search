Is it just me or is getting a random student to pick the exam questions that other random students have to answer a bit like building an SQL query with string concatenation?  It’s not a case of “if this will be abused” but merely “when will this be abused”.

That future teachers don't realize the implications of trying to cheat themselves is, maybe, the best proof of the level of "smartity" of the students :-P .
Also, when you spend more time partying or preparing to party, you end being more aware of the other's appearance and how much effort they put on that.

After graduating from college, I started giving private classes to other students from my faculty. Some of my pupils had started the degree two or three years before me, yet they still had some dangling subjects. I suspect, given their level of practice, that their true degree wasn’t Computer Science, but Partiology.

Thank you for another delightful off-topic music post. *Another* bit of irony is that the "hard" keys of B major and Bb minor are generally easier to play. While the key signatures may have more # and b symbols, both use all of the black keys, and this topography gives your hand more room to cross the thumb under/cross the middle/ring fingers over. (I'll allow that Bb *harmonic* minor is a bit thorny, with the...Read moreThank you for another delightful off-topic music post. *Another* bit of irony is that the “hard” keys of B major and Bb minor are generally easier to play. While the key signatures may have more # and b symbols, both use all of the black keys, and this topography gives your hand more room to cross the thumb under/cross the middle/ring fingers over. (I’ll allow that Bb *harmonic* minor is a bit thorny, with the gap from G-flat to A-natural.) Comparatively, a key like E minor is actually harder to remember the fingering for, and harder to realize in performance, because you only have one black key, and it’s *not* where you do any crossing over/under, so the topography is working against you. A slightly cleverer student would have chosen one of these “hard” keys and gotten away with it, because no one would suspect anyone to cheat with a five-sharp key signature. On the other hand, any student who notices this about the topography of the keyboard probably doesn’t need to cheat in the first place — but putting in the time to have this epiphany would get in the way of partying.
