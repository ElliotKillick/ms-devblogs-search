You could use something else as the identity, for recursion purposes. Like a task id or the address of the  coroutine handle.

Task id could work, although it creates the hassle of having to pass it around. Coroutine address is not useful because all that would detect is the same coroutine entering the mutex twice, which is not a common scenario. Usually, itâ€™s where one function enters the mutex, and then it calls another function that also enters the mutex. And the two functions need not themselves be coroutines.
