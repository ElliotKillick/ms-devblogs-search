Raymond, on the topic of performance counters, what is an “auxiliary counter”? Some functions relating to them are documented, e.g. ConvertAuxiliaryCounterToPerformanceCounter, but the docs never explain what an “auxiliary counter” is, why you’d want to use one, how you create one, etc.

Surely the customer would have meant a Windows Performance Counter that needs API calls to create and update, rather than just an internal only counter?

Another thing to take into account is that performance counters sometimes alter the magnitude being measured. A counter uses some memory and takes some CPU time to update, so it is worth taking into account if you are measuring CPU or memory usage. Specially if you are trying to profile an specific function or object, which sometimes implies switching the counter on and off thousands of times per second.

But it’s just another case that can be solved by asking yourself “How would I implement it?”. Maybe you idea isn’t an optimal implementation, but the answer will shed some light in how the counter works, and how it can affect the magnitude being measured.
