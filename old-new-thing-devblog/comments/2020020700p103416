Can anybody give a good rationale why Windows changes the user session display resolution when the session gets locked and/or the monitor gets turned off, with locked session or not (or after RDP disconnect).
Itâ€™s so very annoying when you unlock your session and see all layouts changed. Is it so difficult to just have the pseudo-adapter of the locked session inherit the display settings from the actual adapter or RDP session?

This is similar to an old problem I used to get:
Why does my program work when I turn on debugging, but fails when I turn debugging off?!?!?!?
Turned out I was trying to debug my low-level character output routines with my debugger that used the low-level character output routines. Doh! ðŸ™‚
(btw: yay! TNOT lets me log in again!)

Windows 7 Embedded is still a thing. Extended support doesnâ€™t end for another 18 months, I know of retailers actively upgrading to it now that extended support for PosReady 2009 has ended.

The fact that you donâ€™t know if your psychic powers were effective without asking the client suggests you donâ€™t have psychic powers.

Raymond does have psychic powers: theyâ€™re just very specialized. He never claimed to have every psychic power.

Reminds me of an interesting feature I observed playing with Windows 10. I set the screen resolution using qres when explorer was not running, and after starting explorer shell Windows set itself back to the previous resolution.
