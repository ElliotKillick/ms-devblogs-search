That is a failure of the QA and code reviews.
If the intern can slip through a prank, good for them. This actually helps strengthen the company processes.
I can understand the “temporary firing”, but hope Microsoft actually held onto such an individual for the long run.

I think the time of Win 3.1 "code review" was not even exist as established software development concept, and it's unclear whether the build was selected as beta release before the test team have chance to fully checked it (we know beta software are unfinished ones and can contain bugs, so a bit unrealistic to require test team check it fully before release it. Worse, the test team head shouldn't have known about the prank,...Read moreI think the time of Win 3.1 “code review” was not even exist as established software development concept, and it’s unclear whether the build was selected as beta release before the test team have chance to fully checked it (we know beta software are unfinished ones and can contain bugs, so a bit unrealistic to require test team check it fully before release it.

I’ve certainly known builds selected for beta testing by a customer that didn’t even install properly.

Yup, definately a case of “bad pointer leaked into the public”.
And IMO, this case is caused by arbitrary value. And bug caused by arbitrary value, even if just off-by-one from the value it should be, shouldn’t be classified as “off-by-one” error.

I think you missed the humor. There is a cursor with the pointing finger. This one uses the next finger. Therefore, it’s an “off-by-one” error.

No, I didn’t miss it.
The correct value is cursor with pointer finger, but he set it with cursor with middle finger. That’s what we call arbitrary value.
Say, if a function should return “Message ABCD” that is internal hash value of 1234, but I returned “Message FGHI” that has internal hash value of 1235, it’s still not classified as “off-by-one” bug.

It’s a joke.

I got caught by something like that once.  I’ll leave the exact details under wraps but I was asked to “refrain from putting Joseph Stalin quotes in the user manuals”.
