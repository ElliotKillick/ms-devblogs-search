Raymond, you might want to let devblogs know that the RSS feed in your footer isn’t valid – it points to https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/author/oldnewthingfeed/ which is a 404 – it should be https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/feed

This is one of the things that bugs me about C# – whether objects are reference or value types is done at definition time, rather than instantiation/use time.  Of course, that’s mostly because I tend to conecntrate on immutable types, where the distinction is pretty narrow.

I think c# is in a better place for not needing copy constructors, move constructors, assignment operators, move operators and all the syntactic sugar c++ had to come up with to avoid that distinction and make it work efficiently.
Hell, value type semantics are already complicated enough that I doubt most developers understand them (go and ask some colleagues what the reasons for immutable structs were)
