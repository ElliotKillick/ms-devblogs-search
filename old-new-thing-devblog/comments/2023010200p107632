With the deprecation of UWP, there is hardly any value making use of Windows.Data.Json or any other Windows Runtime components really.
The developer tooling available on CsWinRT and C++/WinRT isn't on pair with what .NET Native and C++/CX offered (already 5 years into this), and going via Win32 or language native options is much easier and more productive, even if it requires a couple of KB more, using NuGET and vcpkg is much less painful than...Read moreWith the deprecation of UWP, there is hardly any value making use of Windows.Data.Json or any other Windows Runtime components really.

I thought that just using UWP for GUI is deprecated. Many of other new Windows APIs are part of UWP. Though Microsoft’s terminology is very confusing.

In theory you should use WinUI 3.0 with WinAppSDK, in practice UWP still has better tooling and WinUI 3.0 is years away to achieve parity.

I would disagree with that, actually. WinDev’s latest Windows App SDK uses WinRT very extensively. In addition, the SDK headers we are currently using for Windows app development isn’t very modern, I would add that.

WinAppSDK is only relevant for the poor souls that still think WinUI 3.0 has any future during the next decade.
Sadly MAUI also decided to bet the farm on it, and had to ship a webwidget for bing maps, as the control from UWP still hasn’t been ported.

That GTA Online sidebar is pretty interesting. The moral I took from it is that modern hardware may save you from thinking hard most of the time, but it won’t help if your algorithm is slower by an order of magnitude or more. You still need to be able to tell apart a linear algorithm from a quadratic one.

Hello and happy new year!
There is a minor typo near the end of the article:
Most of the time, the original JSON data [is] in UTF-8 format, and the final output is also in UTF-8 format, so you have extra conversion steps on either side.
The sentence requires “is” where I specified above.
