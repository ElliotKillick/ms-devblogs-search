I’m a bit late here, but you can enable the fantastic rerere option of git (reuse recorded resolution). This will magically save the way you resolved the merge conflict, and reuse it automatically when it detects the same conflict in future.

Hey, this one I’ve actually used. The other tricks in this series are beyond my paygrade.

This way, you don't get the messages of the commits being squashed into the resulting commit. So, it's more like a fixup in `rebase` terms.
For resolving repeating merge conflicts, there's rerere, so that's not a strong argument.
So, for the first part, I would rather just rebase the donor branch to the base interactively, squashing all the commits (afterwords, reset the donor branch). Then, cherry-pick the new commit as you do.

Another thing is that for me it’s easiest to work with a handful of porcelain commands and not bother with the plumbing ones. On the other hand, I handle with a hierarchy of subrepos under Linux. A mid-sized monorepo on Windows gives you plenty of time to go plumbing, I figure ;-).

Any reason why you don’t use the –squash option of git merge? This way you even get a collective commit message that can help you write the new squashed commit’s message.

That would pick up all the other changes in the donor branch that came before A.
