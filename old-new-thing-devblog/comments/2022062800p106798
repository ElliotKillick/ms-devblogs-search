For example, a team might casually say that ‚ÄúThe widget sends a message to another widget‚Äù, when really what happens is that the widget controller sends the message to the other widget‚Äôs controller.

Here‚Äôs the Merriam Webster discussion: https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/the-inside-scoop-on-inside-baseball.  I grew up watching the Montreal Expos under manager Gene Mauch (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Mauch).  He was the master of the small ball game.
