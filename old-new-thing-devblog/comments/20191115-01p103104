Regarding the + in a phone number, I do recall it’s also valid to use a double zero (00) prefix as a replacement of the +. That said, if it’s fully treated as a number those leading zeroes will also just be stripped.

Falsehood number 23. In the United States, the international dialing prefix is 011, not 00.

Well, yeah, but assuming that the people behind the website are in the UK, they would have to prefix their call with 00 to reach you.
As a German who's been living in the US for a few years, but still keeps ties, I am well versed into entering the "least confusing" alternative into phone number fields by now.

One of the most interesting differences is that US numbers are fixed length. In Germany at least, they are variable length prefix free numbers. My parents live in a very big city and still have a 6 digit number, simply because they had that number for many decades. (Other minor differences: There is no “x” notation for extensions. Area codes start with 0 and are variable length as well. Germany has separate numbers for police and “emergency”: 110 and 112; the latter often perceived as for the “fire department”, which isn’t strictly false, but you can call for any non-police emergency.)

True, but at the time, I didn’t know what the UK international dialing prefix is. In the US, we barely know our own international dialing prefix, much less anybody else’s.

Fun fact: the US, Canada and many Caribbean nations are part of what’s called the North America Numbering Plan (NANP) which means they all share the same international calling prefix (+1) with different area codes within the system. This probably contributes to American ignorance of international dialing as most of our immediate neighbors, particularly our English-speaking neighbors, can be reached without having to use proper international dialing.

Oh, I see. I think it's more common knowledge in Europe, given that several countries are packed tightly on the continent, and it's common to have relatives in another country, or just be on vacation abroad a lot. (We also tend to have much more vacation, making traveling more common. I'm still amazed at my coworkers here in the US taking one week long vacations to other countries... how is there time for anything?)

At least pre-ubiquitous-Internet, when there was more reason for plain old phone calls.

I wonder if the bother to use input type=number, why not just use input type=tel?
Maybe it’s because the option is not offered by web component they use?

Ah yes, #25 on the list of Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Phone Numbers: Phone numbers are numbers.

The + (or lack thereof) would be irritating; in the UK, handling number as numerical values also has the irritating problem in many cases of eating the leading 0 (where US numbers use a 1 to indicate long-distance, the UK uses a 0).

I took my wife on the ‘Thames Clipper’ boat, then crossed back again on the cable car (‘Emirates Air Line’ I think?). We both have US and UK numbers now, forwarding from one to the other depending where we are at the time, which simplifies a lot of things: much easier to use an in-country number in the expected format. Some things do manage to work just fine with foreign numbers – but not enough to be comfortable without one IMO.
