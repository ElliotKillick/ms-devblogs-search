For merging lots of files you might need this:
git merge -X find-renames=2
Found via this stackoverflow q&a.  The key to look for is merge printing “CONFLICT (rename/rename)” instead of “CONFLICT (rename/add)” or similar.

Not only can you do it, in many cases, you must do it to avoid unwanted spaces, or to avoid conflicts with lines that end with a digit.

It’s O(n²) in the number of files changed? Unless you’re asking it to detect copies, I would have thought it would only be O(n²) in the number of files deleted, or am I missing something?

Oops, you’re right. it’s O(m×n), where m is the number of added files, and n is the number of deleted files. But in the Windows repo, that’s still a very large number when, say, an aggregation branch merges into the trunk.
