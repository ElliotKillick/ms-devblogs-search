I’m eager to find out if the authors of ATL CComPtr had clairvoyance, deep skills, luck, some friends on the standards committee, or a heady combination of all of this.

It is still the best way to do COM in C++, the later ones that followed it (WRL, C++/WinRT), have hardly done any improvements, specially if one is also authoring components and not only consuming them.
Visual Studio tooling for COM in C++ has hardly been touched since ATL days (if we ignore C++/CX for that).

ATL was always king, so i’m not surprised they managed this one as well
