Interesting. I never knew that ASLR would do more than just change the addresses, but could also end up changing the effective size of the stack. I suppose this could lead to random and difficult to debug crashes when stack utilisation is close to the limit. If the sample program had a cut-off at a recursion depth on 4880, it would sometimes crash, sometimes not.
