Are you testing some kind of blogging AI that gets some facts and writes a blog post from them?
Because no human could possibly think that purchasing some PCs and then order Pizza for the manufacturer makes those PCs ‚ÄúPizza-powered‚Äù.

The production line was partly powered by pepperoni pizza. Grant me some artistic license, will ya?

How can you be so cruel?! Do you know how many colorful, sarcastic retorts I‚Äôve fought back since I‚Äôve read your reply? Adhering to the Code of Conduct is not fun‚Ä¶ üòâ

But if you really are talking to me, I should say that I genuinely thought this blog post is written by an AI. That‚Äôs what Microsoft is doing lately. I did my best to come off polite and lighthearted. If a ‚Äúsilly war‚Äù has been a started as a result of this educated observation of mine, I‚Äôm afraid I neither intended it nor should accept the responsibility of triggering it.

I don't know, what I said was the common way to do this AFAIK in the old time.
When my grandfather was the manger of a warehouse, he told the truck drivers to buy him foods and other things when they drive back with goods.
That said, the people worked in the factory and warehouse including the truck drivers are all my relatives, so things are pretty casual when they need food from homeland to relieve nostalgia.

@Cheong00 My reply wasn‚Äôt meant for you. You can tell from its indentation that it is meant for Raymond Chen.

If I were Alice, I would have told whoever tasked to help ship the computer back to Microsoft to buy pizza on the way to the factory.
Then again the story would have been less interesting than it is.

An actual check right off the bat?  I‚Äôm surprised it wasn‚Äôt a purchase order with a check to be cut later by the accounts payable department.

Major manufacturer basically had 2 choices at this point:
1) Tell Microsoft they could not help.  This has the consequence that manufacturer and/or Microsoft would have to basically say, "Hardware X does not work well with Windows NT." Customers of manufacturer would refuse to upgrade to Windows NT.  This is rather ugly.

2) Help Microsoft.
While #2 is a far more consumer-friendly choice, #1 is an easy choice to make, and probably would not have done much damage to Manufacturer, unless Manufacturer had advertised their devices as Windows NT compatible.
So, kudos to manufacturer for making the consumer-friendly choice.
