I’m also very curious what goes into the “Is a Tablet PC” determination. My work laptop isn’t a “tablet” in any traditional sense of the word, though it does have a touchscreen, and I’m prompted to use “Ctrl+Alt+Del or Windows Security button,” even though I have no idea what this “Windows Security button” might be in this instance.

“Tablet PC” was the marketing name for a specific class of PC. I’m surprised anyone makes them any more. My guess is that your manufacturer set the flag incorrectly in their device configuration. One of the features of the “Tablet PC” is that there was a dedicated “Secure Attention Sequence (Ctrl+Alt+Del)” button on the chassis.

FYI, I’m pretty sure the autorun should only be used to run SET commands. It seems kind of like having a .bashrc; put something stupid in there and you will have a bad day.

There's got to be a little more nuance here. Pretty sure Windows wouldn't ask me to use the power button on my desktop PC case and the volume spinner on my keyboard at once to log in. :) I guess it's either looking for a non-keyboard Volume Down button or the power button on PC cases is considered a different kind of button than the one you're talking about (I know some PC keyboards have...Read moreThere’s got to be a little more nuance here.
