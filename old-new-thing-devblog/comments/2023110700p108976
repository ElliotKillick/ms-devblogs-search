Last week we had auto-generated content farming for Windows kernel stop codes.  This week we have Windows vulnerability reports written by AI.  The reporter has no more understanding of file systems than any of the AI models, and yet they churned out a plausible-on-the-surface security bug report.

I’m surprised that there exists someone that can’t understand the difference. And I’m not even a system administrator. Just a C++ programmer.

On a fileserver, whenever a folder is shared, hit "disable inheritance" on the NTFS rights. For any folder below which has different access rights do the same: No inherited rights are supposed to be left.
On larger environments having several levels of mixed inherited rights is a nightmare to manage, and if a right changes on a parent folder it can take days, literally, until all subfolders with mixed inheritance are updated.

On larger environments having several levels of mixed inherited rights is a nightmare to manage, and if a right changes on a parent folder it can take days, literally, until all subfolders with mixed inheritance are updated. Mixed inherited and non-inherited rights can lead to weird effects on access where it gets time costly to trace it down instead of doing it right in first place.
As for “deny” access: I avoid it as much as possible. Create an extra write-group (+ extra read-group if needed), following RBAC/ABGL logic, is much better. The ONLY deny right I set on such a “separate ACL” folder is “deny delete” on “everyone”. It not only catches accidental deletion, it catches accidental moving that folder to wherever an acting-up touchpad thinks it should be.
