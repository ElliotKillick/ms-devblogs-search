Is probing really the answer?  I’m not really sure what to think here.  In the old days, Windows moved slowly and these issues didn’t seem to exist.  Now with release early and often we have these new problems.  Why not code with what works rather than probe?  Which is better:  Probing code that is stuck for a long time?  Or “old school” code that just works but there’s a new better way?
