Fast ABI can be enabled on types to avoid the need to use multiple interfaces. C++ WinRT has some support for this but I’ve not looked at it closely.

If COM interface pointers are always aligned to sizeof(void*), a projection could use the least significant bits for a few “upgrade” flags. All COM method calls would then have to mask the bits off, perhaps costing more than the rare QueryInterface calls.
