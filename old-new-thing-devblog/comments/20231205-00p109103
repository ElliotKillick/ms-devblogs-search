Which also reminds me of MS OS/2 2.0 and DR-DOS.

The number one 64-bit platform could have been Windows Phone 10 but our favorite CEO threw the race and burned it all down.

We were told there were no apps but honestly you only need a dozen good developers to write all the phone apps the world needs, or even better, generalize the functionality as WP did so the UI only has to be written once and every service becomes a headless plugin. What a shame. Android is such obfuscated garbage, a maze whose walls always keep changing.

Microsoft were in a prime position for the coming smartphone OS wars.
All of the developers were already writing for PocketPC devices. It had a huge number of apps.
Then Windows Mobile 6 and 6.5 feel behind the curve with a stylus based UI.
Then for Windows Phone 7 someone decided that development tools were .Net only so nobody bothered developing software for it. And the rest was history…

Exactly! I loved Windows Phone 10. And lots of colleagues used it or wanted to use it next or were simply interested and would have used it. I always wonder what made MSFT keep changing their strategy…

0.8 × 0.7 × 0.9 is only slightly more than 50% of adults. And as adults don’t restrict themselves to using only smartphones, it’s quite possible that a desktop OS (we don’t use names here, right?) might have even larger market share at the same time but in a different segment.

Personally, I'm tired of all these "usage quota wars". 2024 is going to be the year of a certain OS whose mascot is an stuffed arctic animal. As it was going to be 2023, and 2022, and 2021...

As it was going to be 2023, and 2022, and 2021… And the company whose logo is a bitten fruit used to shout its two-digit year-over-year gains in quota back when it was recovering from nearly dead in the late 90s (and stopped doing so when it touched its own ceiling and stopped growing, of course). All this reminds me of high school pep rallies (see XKCD comic number 588). My OS is better than yours because it has more users. Isn’t it? Right?
Well, I think we all are Engineers (yes, with a capital “E”). We should select a product or technology based on its ability to solve the problem we have at hand and, perhaps, our level of expertise with it. I don’t think usage quota has anything to do with either.
