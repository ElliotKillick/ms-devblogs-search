I recommend to avoid coming up with new terminologies when they already exist. What you are looking for here is a barrier synchronization monitor. It is easy to implement with C++ coroutines using a task wait queue internally.

You should mention the presumably cpp24 std algorithms (when_all_*, etc) for achieving the same results.

It looks like when_all is for futures, not coroutines.
