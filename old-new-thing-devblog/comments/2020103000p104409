Do companies actually upgrade their systems to 1809?

Presumably the problem is that it came with or was provisioned with 1809 and upgrades were shut off, since it was a point of sale system. This kind of point-release API problem is tricky if you work with small businesses and can’t budget to keep everything perfectly in sync.
