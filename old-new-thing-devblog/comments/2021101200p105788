Similar to Ethernet, Microsoft Azure is named after the Firmament, the non-breachable blue water dome covering the planar earth. The name commemorates total control of the earth, which is exactly how I‚Äôve understood ‚ÄúThe Cloud‚Äù since its inception.

It is cute that you report such benign accidents. There are less benign ones, though.

Want something more suitable for your blog? Okay. Once, Microsoft OneDrive popped up and warned me that I had 752 MB of files that I could back up to OneDrive. I checked the report. 95 MB of the whole volume belonged to the files on my Desktop, which were temporary. I move them at the end of the day after I finish my work. 7 MB belonged to the accidentally taken snapshots with Windows+PrtScr. I deleted those. The remaining 652 MB belonged to the contents of the notorious Documents folder. Now, I never store anything in that folder because we all know every app likes to dump its settings or temp files there. Still, I checked. The 652 MB belonged to PowerShell help files! They don‚Äôt need to be backed up to the cloud because they come from the cloud.
