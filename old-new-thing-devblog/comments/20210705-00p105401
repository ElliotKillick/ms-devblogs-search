Never heard the song before clicking the link in the post – looks like it from late 80’s when that was not my type of music. I don’t think I would have thought of basketballs if I hadn’t read Raymond’s post, but now that I have it definitely sounds like basketballs.

I can’t help but picture Sting being very confused because he didn’t use “West African Tribal Drum” on that song… he used Basketball.
