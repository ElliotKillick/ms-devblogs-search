seems like it's time to unify and just remove the modulo part of the logic. After all entering a larger value that relies on the wrap-around might occasionally be part of somebody's muscle memory, but it's probably rare. And having access to the entire codepage/unicode seems like a win.
 given the discussion of alternate, more mnemonic methods, it probably won't matter much either way.

Great article. I never knew that the value rolled over like that. I used to memorize the keys that I wanted to use but didn‚Äôt really know the history or how it all worked.

Why was support for taking the entered value mod _anything_ added? Why not treat it as an error (I‚Äôm thinking beeping the PC speaker, lol) if larger than the maximum supported number?

The IBM PC BIOS didn't add code to take the value mod anything; rather, it didn't add code to detect that there was an overflow from the single byte it kept. The relevant chunk of BIOS code is:

The relevant chunk of BIOS code is:

MOVAL,ALT_INPUT; GET THE CURRENT BYTE
MOVAH,10; MULTIPLY BY 10
MULAH
ADDAX,DI; ADD IN THE LATEST ENTRY
MOVALT_INPUT,AL; STORE IT AWAY

This is the code that adds the typed value (in DI) to the byte stored in ALT_INPUT. There‚Äôs two places for an overflow of the byte to occur ‚Äì the ‚ÄúMUL AH‚Äù which multiplies the existing value by 10 (and can thus turn 26 into 260), and the ADD AX, DI which adds in the value you just typed (and can thus turn 250 into 256, 257, 258 or 259). You‚Äôd have to add extra code to this routine to detect either of those overflow cases and treat it as an error; otherwise, when you do ‚ÄúMOV ALT_INPUT, AL‚Äù at the end, the value in AX is taken mod 256 automatically, by the definition of the AL register.
And this is for a constrained system; the BIOS on the original IBM PC is in an 8 KiB ROM chip, in the days when ROM wasn‚Äôt cheap. Adding extra instructions to check for error and beep instead of taking the input wouldn‚Äôt be seen as a good use of ROM space for an advanced user feature ‚Äì since it‚Äôs likely to either push something else out of the BIOS (and if so, what), or increase the price of the BIOS ROM in a ‚Äúcheap‚Äù system.

One neat feature in Ubuntu and Linux Mint (not sure exactly which component is responsible for it) is the ability to use Ctrl+Shift+U to enter a hex Unicode code point.
Comes in handy for inserting TAB characters in the text editor when it‚Äôs configured to use spaces instead of tabs (Makefiles, for instance, require TAB characters). Especially since it turns out that a single 9 without leading zeros is sufficient!

Most IDEs and advanced text editors can set the indentation style depending on file type. The EditorConfig standard allows to define these settings in an editor-independent way.

Most likely it came from an IME engine, either ibus or fcitx5 (both supports the ctrl+shift+u shortcut). Considering you‚Äôre using Ubuntu and Mint, which by default ships gnome[-related] desktop environments, it‚Äôs probably ibus. (gnome has builtin support for it).

If you enable it in the registry, Windows does allow you to press Alt + and then the codepoint hex sequence, and the + is a key you have to press.
I always wonder why this isn‚Äôt enabled by default.

You can use WinCompose to easily type almost any character :

I haven't tried that one before, thanks. Additionally, Microsoft has "Quick Accent" as part of their PowerToys.
It would be nice if Windows had an option like smartphone keyboards do, where you could just hold down a key and then use the arrow keys to select which accented version you wanted. Currently, if you hold down a key, it just keeps typing that character repeatedly until you release it. Does anyone actually need to do that...Read moreI haven‚Äôt tried that one before, thanks.

Luckily, Word 2003 (as well as the rest of Office products) is still a thing and it just works, and doesn‚Äôt have the stupid Gibbon interface. Those brand new ZIP-files get converted with MS-provided converter quite well, and if some document doesn‚Äôt, that‚Äôs the other party‚Äôs problem: any decent document should not use stuff that causes the converter to fail.

for me they unfortunately explode as soon as they display the open or save as dialog
thankfully I can use Libre and it handles scaling much better than old Office did but the speed, the speed! I‚Äôm pretty sure Word 2003 takes less time to launch than modern win11 notepad does

Actually, modern tools (be they laptops or keyboards or Windows) de-emphasized the utterly non-mnemonic, primitive, and clumsy alt sequences for a darn good reason.

And replaced them with something far easier and better. Because the need for everyone everywhere to enter international characters is only growing as the world gets smaller and more multilingual.
If you are a) an American, and b) need to type characters not commonly found on a US hardware keyboard, the correct answer is to enable the English United States International keyboard.  It‚Äôs in Settings under Keyboards.  Once enabled, you can toggle back and forth between the domestic and international versions of the keyboard with a single chord: [Windows]+[Spacebar].
With the keyboard in international mode, typing √± is the far _more_ mnemonic ~n. The various other diacritics are equally simple. Type a : for umlaut, a `, ^ or ‚Äò for the three kinds of accent, then the letter to be modified and suddenly Roberto es tu t√≠o. I have no doubt your daughter will find ~n far more memorable and easy than she will find alt+194.

I wish keyboards had an ‚ÄúInternational Lock‚Äù key to toggle between standard English US and English US International keyboards.
I need to use International occasionally, but if I leave it on all the time, it gets in the way. English does on a few rare occasions use umlauts to indicate that two consecutive vowels make two separate sounds (e.g., ‚Äúna√Øve‚Äù), but most of these words have just dropped the umlaut altogether.

Doesn‚Äôt ctrl+shift do it for you? That should cycle through different layouts for the same language. I use that to shift between UK and UKX on my system all the time.
Then again, on UK Extended, most of the dead keys are enabled using altgr, where the back tick is the only one that is a dead key by default.

I‚Äôm sure you can find similar layouts for other languages.
There is the UK Extended layout as another example of this.
