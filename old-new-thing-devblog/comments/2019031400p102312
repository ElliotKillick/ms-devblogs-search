Does the need to be admin strictly rules-out security vulns? It is my understanding that regular Windows installs with regular configuration do not allow unsigned kernel code. If I find a way to inject some arbitrary kernel code but need admin rights to do it, is it a vuln or not?

I love this blog because it thoroughly demonstrates, through an unbiased sampling of bug reports, that there’s never ever a privilege escalation issue in the Windows kernel.Only people submitting “other side of the airtight hatchway” ! All the time !I’m so glad I’m a paying Windows customer (I really am) because there’s no CVE up there.

While discussion of actual OS security bugs can often be interesting, I can think of several reasons why Mr. Chen might not include it in his blog (he might not be allowed to; there might not be a suitable lesson applicable to much of his target audience; he might find it not sufficiently rewarding to be worth the extra effort). I expect the first is the most likely, since any in-depth discussion of a specific...Read moreWhile discussion of actual OS security bugs can often be interesting, I can think of several reasons why Mr. Chen might not include it in his blog (he might not be allowed to; there might not be a suitable lesson applicable to much of his target audience; he might find it not sufficiently rewarding to be worth the extra effort). I expect the first is the most likely, since any in-depth discussion of a specific bug would likely deal with commercial-in-confidence information.
Fortunately, it’s a big internet, and there are other sites you can go to if you want to read analysis of OS bugs.

I think thats a misunderstanding of security in the kernel. Once a user has the ability to run code in kernel mode there isn't much the system can do per se. The security issue is them being able to run code in the kernel at all. So it's not an 'escalation of privlidge' in the kernel, it's a remote code execution at that point. Escalation of privlidge inherently affects user mode code only (even if...Read moreI think thats a misunderstanding of security in the kernel.

So it’s not an ‘escalation of privlidge’ in the kernel, it’s a remote code execution at that point. Escalation of privlidge inherently affects user mode code only (even if the actual defect is in kernel mode code). This is why the `Nt` vs `Zw` function prefixes exist, so that kernel entry points can validate their callers (and should).
