While we’re on the topic with WinRT, I wonder if “removal of built-in WinRT support of .NET 5” will have impact on C++/WinRT or there will be another project to support it.

C++/WinRT doesn’t use .NET at all – it’s a C++ library – so changes to .NET shouldn’t affect it.

Okay, I mixed it up.
I saw C++/WinRT is for writing UWP and always thought it is a .NET technology.
