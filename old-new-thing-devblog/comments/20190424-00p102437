Cannot stress enough how a good Administrative Assistant is valuable to their teams. Without them people cannot focus on their work and productivity goes downhill real quick.

Ok, I admit I did not see that coming. Pretty good prank and “Meredyth” must have really done her job well to fool pretty much the entire team. On a side note, Pam sounds absolutely awesome!

I made a couple of guesses at your email and got it all wrong, so apologies for hijacking this post. I don't know if you were already alerted to this but if you haven't yet, this is an interesting post on the intersection of CreateProcess and CFG with a O(N^2) routine throwing a wrench into the works.

I admit, the last line about the real drill made me smile.

Next time you’re going to plagiarize someone else’s story, maybe at least do a better job introducing the characters (Bruce, in particular). It’s one thing to cite original sources. It’s another to force the reader to just go ahead and read the original sources just to properly understand the story.
Anyway, thanks for sharing. 🙂

Oops, you’re right, I never clearly stated Bruce’s role in the story. Retroactively fixed.

The timestamp of this post is odd. How is 17:57:44 on 4/24 already?Are you posting from a diff timezone?

Well, your post on this has 2019-04-24 18:35:25 as a timestamp for me, so 17:57:44 doesn’t sound strange.

I can’t wait to read your blog in 24 years when you write about Paint and how it was granted a stay of execution several times over.
By the way, I really like to meet this Pam and plant a kiss on her forehead. (I will brush my teeth beforehand.) Assuming she is real of course, and a kiss on the forehead means the same thing in the U.S. as in … ah, never mind.
