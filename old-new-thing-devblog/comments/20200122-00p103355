Oh, but it’s a knob!  We must fiddle with it!  Squirrel!  (OCD reference)

Find a way to set it to an arbitrary parent owned by a different user (and that parent isn’t a login broker) and I’ll call it a security vulnerability. Otherwise, forgettaboutit.

@Joshua: how is that scenario a security vulnerability?  From a user’s perspective, they see only their own processes, so this process would appear to be created a process that has since exited.  “Windows doesn’t really care about parent processes much”.  Having the ID of a process in another user’s session only gets you to the airtight hatchway.  You’d need something else in order to cross the hatchway and become a real vulnerability.

There really needs to be a tag for this series.

A tag would be great, however Raymond is good about the terms he uses.  A bing search of this blog for “airtight hatchway” will find them.
