What’s wrong with having 256 values in an enum? Still fits in a byte, right?

Some compilers, e.g. armcc, use variable-width enums.  When you blow past 255 values the size of your enum goes from 8 to 16 bits, breaking binary compatibility with any API that was built for the <= 255-value enum.

Isn’t enum just dumb integer constants? Or am i thinking ol’ C

The underlying type of an unscoped enum is implementation defined.
But there are two big issues here, first, we don't know what really happens in this case since it was about a witty comment that Raymond put in his code. There could be other issues like alignment issues in a structure to consider.

“The underlying type of an unscoped enum is implementation defined.”
This is why you’ll find enum values, aptly named FORCE_DWORD, in, for example, DirectX headers, to force the enum size to 32 bits

“255 members in this enum ought to be enough for anybody” 🙂
