+10000 Most people want to believe that one value is a sample, but indeed it's a value.
When you ask them about how you'd name these values forming say an L/R signal? They anwser 'frames' or even better, 'a pair of samples' 😂
For the conversion from float to integer, here's how it's done in some frameworks: http://blog.bjornroche.com/2009/12/int-float-int-its-jungle-out-there.html

Once done, in software like Wavelab, you can assert that you have a good master by checking it through the ‘Bit-meter’ window.

Why doesn’t Media Foundation support OGG?  It’s not like there are any licensing requirements. Why doesn’t Media Foundation support every free format up to this point?  It’s not like the code is going to change from year to year. FFMPEG shouldn’t be necessary for anything for the most part.

In Julia an unsigned fixed-point number type N0fn represents a number from 0 to 1 inclusive, using an underlying n-bit unsigned integer, which makes the resolution 1/(2^n – 1).  For example, 0x01 as an N0f8 represents 1/255.  This practice of uniform scaling by (2^n – 1) seems standard in the field of digital signal processing.

Interesting non-standard notation. Old embedded DSP guys use Q notation (eg. Q15) and the newer standard is fx notation (eg. fx1.16 is same as Q15).

Raymond, I have a question for you!
Why does when Task Manager “Options/Always on top” gets clicked, the application “reboots” itself or seems to ?
Thank you.
EDIT:
I’ve uploaded a small GIF that shows what I’m talking about, check it here : https://ibb.co/CndvPVk

This is really off topic, but the answer is that the Task Manager doesn't actually use standard Always on Top. Instead it creates its window in a higher "band". This band is always above all other Always on Top windows. Which is where you want Task Manager to be. Metro apps in Windows 8 used to be in this band, but those now live in the same band as all other windows. Only Task Manager...Read moreThis is really off topic, but the answer is that the Task Manager doesn’t actually use standard Always on Top. Instead it creates its window in a higher “band”.

The program does reboot itself (I don’t know the reason for this design, though), which can be inferred from command line switches. In the current Windows release, the switches /0 ~ /4 means started from Win+X menu / UI in Task Manager / Ctrl+Shift+Esc / Windows Security dialog / Taskbar context menu, respectively. If you start Task Manager and then choose / un-choose Always on Top, the command line switch “changes to” /1.

I remember my Task Manager always showed itself started with /7.  What does that mean?
