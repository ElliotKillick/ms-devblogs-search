I have always been partial to a strategy of build on all of the grain hexes and get a grain near-monopoly.  It isn’t really very effective, but I get to play act being a robber baron and can pretend that I have the nations food supply in my grip.

It looks like it *could* be a fun game. Except that the 6 year old forces you to play and then cries whenever you make a move that may make her lose.

I couldn’t find a reference in some quick online searching just now.)

I don’t know about the original German rules, but the current rules say “Seine übrigen Spielfiguren legt jeder Spieler vor sich ab.” = “Each player places the unused pieces in front of him.”

Wouldn’t buying development cards be better for this strategy, because if you bought a road, that’s one less road for your robot?

No wonder this strategy doesn’t work!
