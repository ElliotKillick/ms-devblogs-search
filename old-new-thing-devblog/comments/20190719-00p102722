Well then, can I safely use this “secret event” for one of several simultaneous I/O requests?
For example, InterlockedIncrement/Decrement’ing the “pending requests” counter and using the “secret event” only when counter was just incremented from zero.

It’s not like there is one secret event for process, or for user. One secret event is hiding behind every file handle! You can use tons of these, only be careful not to perform two operations on the same file.

Oops, it was unclear, I meant “one of several simultaneous I/O requests on certain file handle”. Is it safe to do simultaneously one operation with hEvent = 0, and several others with explicit hEvent’s?
