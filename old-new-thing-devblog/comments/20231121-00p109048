Coming from a radio communications background, I don’t think I realized that line of sight wasn’t a commonly used term.
For us, it’s a clear, unobstructed, direct path from source to destination. As opposed to skip, groundwave, or NVIS communications- all of which are techniques to communicate with someone either over the horizon or behind a mountain.

I understand the term “line of sight” in the visual sense, but it wasn’t clear how that applies to computer networks. Do the two computers have to be connected directly to each other by a taut network cable?

We call that BLOS. Often used in reference to HF radio or SATCOM.
