Another fun thing could happen when the rename mask was longer than the original filename.  Since FCBs padded the base name and extension with spaces, a careless rename could result in filenames with internal spaces.

Technically, spaces were allowed in the middle of a filename. It is impossible to create such a filename from the command line (other than by accident) and a pain to deal with, but they were legal. Back then, one option to work with them was using a ‚Äúgraphical‚Äù file manager, such as DOS Shell, Windows File Manager or GEM Desktop.
