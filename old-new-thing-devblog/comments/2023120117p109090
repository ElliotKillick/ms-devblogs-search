From title: “both an import section and input directory?”, did you mean “both an import section and import directory?”?

Also typo, ‘a’ missing: “nd initialized with these contents”

Here’s me laying out an import section in assembly (for those who need to see an example): https://github.com/joshudson/dossuperfloppy/blob/660586f2bb3d660d8154b0cb6857562dc4892bcf/postntfs.asm#L374

msvc stuffs it into .rdata now. The CRT section as well. Which makes sense, all have the save memory protection flags.
Interestingly,  IDA when disassembling creates a virtual .idata segment by slicing .rdata to make it visually better stick out. When all tables are combined into .rdata that is.

Separate `.idata` section was general in 90’s and extremely rare these days. MSVC linker doesn’t create `.idata` section, it just puts import directory into `.rdata`.

LINK.exe /LINK /NOOPTIDATA … (like /ALTERNATENAME, /LAST etc. unfortunately undocumented) still emits the .idata section.
