I like the D2D teammate‚Äôs suggestion. It parallels the most reliable way to convert the colorspace or pixel format of an image on Apple platforms: create a new bitmap context of the same size and draw your image into it.

The negative pitch triggers difficult memories. Direct3D 10 did not implement it and that broke my engine during the 64-bit transition.
From the dawn of time, I use negative pitch to flip my textures vertically when I pass them to D3D (coordinate system transformation for OpenGL compatible resources). In 2007, 32-bit development was still very common, and everything worked fine there.
When we moved to 64-bit, the texture loading crashed immediately. Why? D3D10_SUBRESOURCE_DATA::SysMemPitch is an unsigned 32-bit...Read moreThe negative pitch triggers difficult memories. Direct3D 10 did not implement it and that broke my engine during the 64-bit transition.

On a 32-bit x86, it doesn‚Äôt matter because adding a large positive 32-bit number to a pointer moves the pointer backwards, like the same negative number in two‚Äôs complement would. (Undefined behavior in C++, but back then nobody seemed to care. The D3D10 debug layer certainly didn‚Äôt.)
On 64-bit systems, adding a large positive 32-bit number to a pointer moves you gigabytes forward, often to no man‚Äôs land. Ooops.
Yes, I should not have put a negative number there. No, I did not do it intentionally. It was a small oversight and worked well before.
Because my texels came from memory-mapped files, I had to introduce a whole new conversion layer. That was painful¬†‚Ä¶

But you just said it was intentional a few sentences earlier!
It‚Äôs hard to say if the original behavior was a bug that turned out to be a feature, or a feature that was buggy, or, or‚Ä¶.

I used negative stride because I always do, and I did not notice D3D not supporting it because I did not look at the data type of the field.
As you said¬†‚Äì it accepting a positive number just below 2^32 was likely a bug (on both sides of the API), but it turned into a feature for me¬†‚Äì until the move to x64, that was.

Nit-picker‚Äôs corner: Both lines containing `RETURN_IF_FAILED` seem to miss a closing parenthesis.
