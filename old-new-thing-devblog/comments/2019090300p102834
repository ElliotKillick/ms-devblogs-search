I used to carry one of these when I traveled all over the United States for customer training engagements. The device had two expansion card slots. We filled one of those slots with a propietary hardware board that emulated a business computer system that was very popular in the hotel industry at the time. With the board, the whole thing weighed about 22 pounds.

With the board, the whole thing weighed about 22 pounds.
On a cross-country trip, the bag‚Äôs shoulder strap had broken, so I had to carry it by the handle on the top. On that trip, I had to change airlines from United to American in O‚ÄôHare. My incoming flight was delayed, so I had to make a mad dash between those terminals without the benefit of the shoulder strap. I was quite the sight, literally running down the conveyor belts with my briefcase in one hand and the portable in the other. When one arm got tired, I would swap, without stopping.
I still missed my connection‚Ä¶

Only a small charge is generally used when detonating a bomb. The bomb‚Äôs actual payload is expected to finish the job.

1000 dollars for 210MB hard drive upgrade in 1992 was a ripoff. I bought a 210 MB Western Digital HDD back in 1992 (or 1993?) for $250. In Russia.

This reminds me of when 128-bit encryption was non-exportable ‚Äúmunitions‚Äù and the State Department had to create a ‚Äúpersonal use‚Äù exception for travel in 1996. Matt Blaze went through the process in 1994/1995.

Speaking of airport security, back in the day a friend I was traveling with got the X-ray operators quite excited, for a minute or two, with his portably CD player and 200 CD binder.¬† Apparently there is just enough metal in the reflective foil foil layer of the stacked CDs to create 4 opaque cylinders on the X-ray; and since he'd stuck his Discman-style CD player into the binder there were also partial views of...Read moreSpeaking of airport security, back in the day a friend I was traveling with got the X-ray operators quite excited, for a minute or two, with his portably CD player and 200 CD binder.¬† Apparently there is just enough metal in the reflective foil foil layer of the stacked CDs to create 4 opaque cylinders on the X-ray; and since he‚Äôd stuck his Discman-style CD player into the binder there were also partial views of batteries and electronics showing in the gaps between those opaque cyliders.Fortunately no bomb squad called; they just had him open his bag, and then the binder, to show what was causing the weird images.

A few years ago I was travelling and didn‚Äôt want my iPod rattling around in my suitcase so I put it into one of the extra pair of shoes I was carrying, along with my earbuds.¬† Apparently, when aiport security x-rayed my suitcase they saw a shoe with wires sticking out of it.¬† Next thing I know I‚Äôm being taken into a room for some questioning.

Didn‚Äôt they have proper, if primitive by modern standards, laptops by the 486 era? (i.e. some sort of clamshell with a display on top and keyboard on the bottom and a battery that could power the thing for an hour or so).¬† What is the use case of the Compaq 486 portable over normal laptop

Answering your question from the subheadline - yes electronics can "tick".
I worked on battery backup box for a radio communications system a few years back. It was controlled by a 16-bit ¬µController that spent most of it's time sleeping (the system was portable so power consumption needed to average in microwatt range). Whenever it woke up from sleep state to do event processing it caused an impulse in the switching power supply. That in...Read moreAnswering your question from the subheadline ‚Äì yes electronics can ‚Äútick‚Äù.
I worked on battery backup box for a radio communications system a few years back. It was controlled by a 16-bit ¬µController that spent most of it‚Äôs time sleeping (the system was portable so power consumption needed to average in microwatt range). Whenever it woke up from sleep state to do event processing it caused an impulse in the switching power supply. That in turn caused the wires in the inductor coil to move slightly resulting in a ‚Äútick‚Äù. Listen closely (i.e. hold it near your ear) and you could hear a tick at about a 1 Hz rate.

That makes two computing devices that I know of to have survived a bomb explosion, with the other being the Game Boy that survived a Gulf War bombing: https://www.ripleys.com/weird-news/unstoppable-game-boy/

IIRC some Bernouli Boxes (?) survived a building demolition and/or fire ages ago (I recall a magazine article about them being recovered after their cases were replaced).¬† A Nintendo Switch survived a drop off a building, but since that (and so many other devices now) has a lith-io battery inside, I definitely wouldn‚Äôt count on it to survive a fire‚Ä¶.Nintendo seems pretty good at ruggedizing their hardware.
