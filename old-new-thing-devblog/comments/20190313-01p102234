It should not have taken me four minutes to figure out how to post here again.
Now I am tasked with revising our Visual Studio toolbar yet again. I only did that last year. Because Microsoft no longer has stable APIs. They want to blame developers for their own ineptitute. "Asychonous loading?" The VS team thinks that will solve their problem? VS is dog slow. "Asyncrhonous loading" will not solve their problem.

Now I am tasked with revising our Visual Studio toolbar yet again. I only did that last year. Because Microsoft no longer has stable APIs. They want to blame developers for their own ineptitute. “Asychonous loading?” The VS team thinks that will solve their problem? VS is dog slow. “Asyncrhonous loading” will not solve their problem. VS 4.x will fire up much faster on far weaker hardware. So now, because of Microsoft’s mistakes, I have to do something twice? Three times? Four times? I’ve already solved the problem of integrating with Visual Studio. Now I have to do it again? Do I have to do this every other year? But of course, Microsoft can be this rude to developers, because it’s Microsoft. Windows even runs the ticket machines at the local Metro train station.

And BTW Ramond -- and I know this might be heresy... I personally have always belived that Windows has a better design that of Unix/Linux. Partially, because I dont want some stupid clone of an operating system from the seventies. My problems with Windows are the following: the unfortunate accident of the VMS pathnames. The unforunate accident of drive letters. Through an accident of history, it doesn't fit with the C language.

But since the move, they don’t seem to be showing up at the same time. Have you lost the ability to schedule your posts or does it not give you fine grain control over the exact timings?

Scheduling is not working. Even automated posting is not working. (The XML-RPC endpoint accepts the post but does not publish it.) Must be done manually. The server folks are investigating.

Also, I just have to say it. The new site is slow – much slower than the old site ever was. It is unbelievable how long pages take to open – we are talking 5-15 seconds. Yes, I submitted this as feedback already, but this just cannot be said enough times. The “upgrade” has been a strict downgrade so far.

Just timed the refresh of this very page to make it painfully easy to understand what it is I am talking about. The refresh took 7.8 seconds. And even after that there was quite a bit of activity in the status bar (using Chrome, no plugins). Anything longer than 2 seconds is unacceptable, and completely out-of-this-world unbelievable for the type of content we have on this page and its amount (utterly miniscule).

The loss of comments to all previous posts is catastrophic.
I have been a reader of this blog since its inception and the knowledge I got from it was enormous. But the majority of the knowledge actually came from comments, not from posts! In terms of knowledge, the value of this blog has been roughly: 20% in the posts from Raymond, 20% in the comments from Raymond where he was answering comments of others, and...Read moreThe loss of comments to all previous posts is catastrophic.
I have been a reader of this blog since its inception and the knowledge I got from it was enormous. But the majority of the knowledge actually came from comments, not from posts! In terms of knowledge, the value of this blog has been roughly: 20% in the posts from Raymond, 20% in the comments from Raymond where he was answering comments of others, and 60% in the comments from other people, who were asking the right questions or answering them or providing valuable insights otherwise.
Without comments this blog just lost 80% of its value. This is completely unacceptable!
Now, I understand that this isn’t Raymond’s fault. However, is there a way to *at least* bring up a readonly copy of the old site with the old comments? Raymond, please, could you ask whoever migrated the blog (and was moronic enough to just strip all comments with no second thoughts) to please make a readonly copy of the old one? Please.

Login with MSFT account works, with Google account does not. So I may not be myself today… Anyway, I wish the RSS feed would consistently include the entire post; makes it a lot easier for quick skimming a bunch at a time. It’s gotten spotty since the Grand Move.
I have no idea how many moves I’ve followed, but I’ve been reading here a long, long time….

This is precisely why people hate Microsoft, if you choose to understand it.
Lately, I've been picturing myself interviewing you, like James Lipton on "Inside the Actors Studio"... because you're such a facinating person, and I have so many questions to ask you. [One of my core functions is to understand the NT loader without reference to source code.] But also, I feel the need to explain to you why even the highest thinkers hate...Read moreThis is precisely why people hate Microsoft, if you choose to understand it.
Lately, I’ve been picturing myself interviewing you, like James Lipton on “Inside the Actors Studio”… because you’re such a facinating person, and I have so many questions to ask you. [One of my core functions is to understand the NT loader without reference to source code.] But also, I feel the need to explain to you why even the highest thinkers hate Microsoft. It is not simply a knee-jerk anti-Microsoft reaction when one discovers for the first time that GetVerion() is lying to you based on the application’s manifest. Microsoft, despite being rooted in Seattle, is just like the Rebublicans: “we will lie to everyone, we will do whatever is necessary, we will even do what is wrong… simply to retain our position of power.”
And now, I learn from Slashdot that Microsoft is going to pester me to upgrade from Windows 7. Windows 7: the last version of Windows that (optionally) presents the UI that I want. Yeah. [Picture Matthew McConaughey in that Lincon commercial.] Oh yeah, like I want Windows 10: I want a “Start” menu with advertisements. That’s totally what I want. Yeah. I’m being sarcastic. Not at all: some of us actually want to get work done.
Now I learn that all my past comments here–from over a deade ago–are lost. This is why people hate Microsoft. Need I explain this further?

No, no it's quite clear that you won't try and understand the reasons behind actions since it's much easier to simply "hate Microsoft".

Why bother understanding the problems behind GetVersion (and why guidance has been for decades to not do version checks but instead check to see if the feature you want is there) or why it’s really complicated to transfer personal information from one website to another under the GDRP, if we can simply complain loudly?

The reasons behind loss of comments were "we have to somehow map old accounts into new ones and we don't want to add means to do that".
