As a Googler, the idea of paying for food seems kind of quaint.

“As a Googler”…  If you work for google, your “free” lunches are paid for by everyone who pays for goods produced by companies who advertise with Google.  The advertising expense is built into the cost of the products.  It’s all just cost-shifting.  So, you ARE paying for your food.

Well I’ve gone somewhat down the rabbit hole…
Having read a lot of money related entries I came across When computer programmers dabble in economics: Buying prepaid lunch vouchers, and not only is it missing as a “Bonus reading” link it’s almost a duplicate of this!
Do I win a prize or is this simple WONTFIX? 🙂

Beat me to the punch, the story seemed super familiar but I didn’t have time to look it up.

It seems since this blog changed sites, that there isn't 'automatic posting' of the day's new item at 7 AM Pacific Time (PDT or PST, depending on time of year), as there used to be.
Is it now a manual process?  Or is the time just way more apparently random than a specific time?
I've followed this blog for well over a decade, and find that I generally learn a lot by reading it.  Thanks...Read moreIt seems since this blog changed sites, that there isn’t ‘automatic posting’ of the day’s new item at 7 AM Pacific Time (PDT or PST, depending on time of year), as there used to be.

Auto-scheduling is broken, so I have to do it manually until they fix it. And I’m on vacation right now, so times are going to be even more erratic than normal.

It’s interesting, because from the WordPress admin page (without admin privileges, thankfully…) I can see that each blog post is posted at 7:00 AM, which suggests the feature is half-working?  Maybe the blog posts are getting stuck in a draft state or something?

They are scheduled for 7am but fail to publish. I have to go in and publish them manually.

“Personal check” 🤣 The 3-hour wait times for checkout must’ve been legendary.

In practice, people wrote personal checks only to purchase another meal card.
