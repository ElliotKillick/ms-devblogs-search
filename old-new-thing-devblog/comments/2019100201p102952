There might be a connection with the “pluralis maiestatis”, or “royal plural”: Since the king or queen would refer to him- or herself as “wir” (“we”, first person, plural), it is only fitting to addess them with “ihr” (second person, plural). And @Victor Agababov, I think all the european languages inherited this custom from the romans. Even the english, although it doesn’t make much of a difference there, as second person is always “you”.

It’s called “T/V distinction” in linguistics, because it’s common for the pronouns to start with those letters, such as tu and vous in French. English has thou and related pronouns, although they too are archaic.

Ah, yes! I remember “thou” from reading Shakespeare in school (and playing Ultima games, of course)!

Thou, thee, thy and thine were used a lot in opera and other literature at that time.

It’s the same in Spanish I think. When you read books about medieval times they all address peers  as vos, rather than usted and reserve tu for subordinates.
