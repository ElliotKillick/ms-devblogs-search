Or you could make
#define uuid(x)  __declspec(uuid(x))
#include "my_intf.h"
He he, just a joke.

that wouldn‚Äôt get rid of the square braces. You‚Äôd have
[uuid("guid")]
turned into
[__declspec(uuid("guid"))]

C++ supports attributes now and non-standard attributes are allowed, you would then make the macro generate [[msvc:uuid(‚Äúguid‚Äù)]] (if MS decides to support this). Or as a hack; [msvc:nop]] __decspec(‚Ä¶) [[msvc:nop] to deal with the unwanted brackets.
In C++17 the compiler must ignore unknown attributes‚Ä¶

There is a request for this on the VS developer community. There is one that is under-review for exposing declspec attributes as actual C++ attributes, something I wish they would do ASAP (along with fixing about 200 bugs ü§£, so I‚Äôll have to be patient).
