The never APIs seem to have adopted the numeric suffix approach (at least, more often than not), incrementing the number as the object provides more flexibility or functionality, which is much more sensible and future-proof.

Every time I see the word "new" in a code comment in code I'm reviewing I flag it for basically the reasons you describe. I also flag the word "now" because it usually requires understanding the way something used to work. (Exception: If the comment also explains the way something used to work and why that way was not good.) Semi-relatedly, I'm also a fan of comments for a line of code that's not there...Read moreEvery time I see the word “new” in a code comment in code I’m reviewing I flag it for basically the reasons you describe.

BTW, don’t forget the University of Oxford’s New College. Founded 1379.

We have a similar problem here in my town with the new housing development area (German: "Neubaugebiet"). There was the new housing development area, which was developed in the late 90s to early 2000s. The area was always referred to as the "Neubaugebiet". But then a new large area was developed in the late 2010s. So now we have the old new housing development area ("alte Neubaugebiet") and the new new housing development area ("neue...Read moreWe have a similar problem here in my town with the new housing development area (German: “Neubaugebiet”).

I wonder what will happen in 10-20 years if there is a third new housing development area. Maybe the totally new new housing development area (“ganz neue Neubaugebiet”)?

I grew up in the UK not too far from the New Forest; it’s managed to retain that name for almost 950 years so far.

We have that same problem where I work with the term “next-gen”. Like – what do you call the thing after the “next-gen widget”? The “Next-next-gen widget”?

So… does adding the word “old” negate the mistake of using the word “new”?
Like, I don’t know… “The Old New Thing” ?

Or, following the Win32 legacy old pattern, upgraded to The Old NewEx Thing. Or, I dunno, The Old New ThingEx. 🙂

Perhaps this blog should now be renamed “The Older Old Thing”.

This is a lesson that most software devs will learn after a year or two on the job. Naming anything “new” is a recipe for disaster.
