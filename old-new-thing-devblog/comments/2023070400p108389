Why is it necessary to terminate the program if a memory allocation failure occurs while trying to allocate the coroutine frame, and what alternative solution is proposed to handle this situation by encoding the termination behavior in the promise itself?

I think there’s an actual way to do it, but I’m not sure if the template generator can build it.
What you want is to preallocate the callback frame at setup time before the callback routines are ever fired.
I’ve actually done this in .NET when something must not fail. It doesn’t come up much.
