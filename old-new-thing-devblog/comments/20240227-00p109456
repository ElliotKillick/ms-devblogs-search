Interesting that you brought this up, since I mentioned this vulnerability in my blog post just 3-4 days before!
https://markusjansson.blogspot.com/2024/02/windows-hello-pin-koodin-haavoittuvuus.html
But you did not answer the question1:
How does Windows know the lenght of my PIN? If my pin is 12345 Windows cant send first "1", then "12", then "123", then "1234" and finally "12345" as Im typing my PIN, to TPM or it would activate its antihammering features. So how does Windows know that my...Read moreInteresting that you brought this up, since I mentioned this vulnerability in my blog post just 3-4 days before!

If my pin is 12345 Windows cant send first “1”, then “12”, then “123”, then “1234” and finally “12345” as Im typing my PIN, to TPM or it would activate its antihammering features. So how does Windows know that my PIN is 5 digits long (or X digits long)?!? Where is this information stored?
And I would like to ask question2 too:
How is EFS key protected when Windows Hello PIN is used? EFS private key is normally encrypted by users Windows password, but when PIN is used the passphrase is not used at all…so how can Windows access EFS private key since user password is not given, only PIN? How is the EFS private key protected and unprotected when Windows Hello PIN is used?

Why does Windows Hello require a PIN as a fallback rather than simply the use the existing username and password that’s already set up?  I needed to turn on Windows Hello recently in order to get PassKeys to work.  Why force people to set up a PIN when they’ve already got a password?

Analogue telephone exchanges went even further, connecting the call as each digit was dialled.

And emulating that behaviour acceptably is one of the challenges ISDN (and nowadays VoIP) had to face down; with the analogue system, you're changing the routing as digits are dialed, so you don't need to know whether you've seen enough digits yet, you just route as people dial, and you're done, with left over digits simply not changing routing.
With digital systems, you either had to have a lookup table for "is this a complete number"...Read moreAnd emulating that behaviour acceptably is one of the challenges ISDN (and nowadays VoIP) had to face down; with the analogue system, you’re changing the routing as digits are dialed, so you don’t need to know whether you’ve seen enough digits yet, you just route as people dial, and you’re done, with left over digits simply not changing routing.
With digital systems, you either had to have a lookup table for “is this a complete number” and encode all the local rules into it (e.g. 411 is complete, but 555 could be either a 4 digit prefix or 7 digit number depending on local history, while 1 650 555 is always a prefix to an 11 digit number), or a way to send a partial number and find out if it completes a route or not (so when you dial 011 44, that sends the number to the international switch, which says that it knows to route it to the UK, but needs more digits, but when you dial 011 44 635 1234, that’s a complete number while 011 44 1 811 805 is incomplete, but would complete with an extra 5 on the end).
You can, of course, mix the two, so that the lookup table says “if you get this far, just send the number and see if it completes”.

In some cases, they just dropped some of the original behavior. For example, in the town I grew up in, let's call it Town A, if you were calling someone in the same exchange, you could dial the last five digits of the number and it would connect. In a nearby small town, Town H, you could dial just the last four digits to talk to someone in town, but to talk to someone elsewhere...Read moreIn some cases, they just dropped some of the original behavior.

In a nearby small town, Town H, you could dial just the last four digits to talk to someone in town, but to talk to someone elsewhere in the county you had to first connect to the exchange in Town A, so if you were calling someone in Town P, you had to dial the first two digits of the Town A exchange, followed by the entire 7 digits of the Town P number, so you’d dial AA-PPP-xxxx. (As you may have guessed, the fact that the last 5 digits would connect a call within Town A is actually a consequence of this.)
There were also some other quirks that most people didn’t know, like that HHH-79xx was the same number as HHH-29xx, and the only difference was that the 79xx number was a payphone. This wasn’t a particularly useful piece of knowledge, but it was a quirk of the configuration of that particular electromechanical switch.
When they upgraded to digital switching, all of those little tricks stopped working. I know of at least one company whose burglar and fire alarms stopped working correctly when the 4-digit shortcut went away, and nobody noticed for years.

It became really eerie to walk through the building when they turned off all of that hardware after they built a small air-conditioned room in one small corner of the building to house the new computerized switch.

I always hate it when I mistype a digit in my PIN and the application starts validating immediately. Yes I know I made a typo, shut up and let me correct it.

>If you feel strongly about it, you can set your organization’s PIN policy to force alphanumeric PINs.
I think that needs a better name, "alphanumeric PINs" is kinda clunky.  Since they're being used as a code to get past something, we could call them passcodes... but then we probably also want to encourage people to use full words rather than just throwing in token letter, so how about passwords?

Yeah, that’s it, we’ll call alphanumeric PINs “passwords”.

It’s not quite the same as a password, because this “alphanumeric PIN” works only on that specific device, whereas the password can be used to sign in with that account on any device.

Besides, an “alphanumeric personal identification number” is a contradiction in terms.

Hasn’t Fabrikam always been the “other” Contoso?
It seems Raymond prefers Contoso, but Fabrikam is one of the other fake MS companies.

I used to get visits from the police if I didn't answer the phone at 3 am to tell the operators that it was a false call. I found out that the field mice were chewing on the exposed phone cables. seems that land lines still support the old rotary dialing.

I found out that the field mice were chewing on the exposed phone cables. seems that land lines still support the old rotary dialing. And, mice chewing through cords can bite nine times, take a break, bite once, take another break. My phone company proactively called the emergency services (9-1-1 in the US) after getting ten pulses (the nine followed by the one).

I got a call from the emergency services once in the middle of the night since I supposedly called 911 & hung up (I assumed I must have done it while ‘sleepwalking’ or something?), I wonder if something analogous could happen with wireless phones & interference…
