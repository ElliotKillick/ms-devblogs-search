A good example of how confusing to most of us still is to mix COM, C++/WinRT and the new kid in town, WIL that is only documented on github.

I’m not sure if
namespace winrt {
  using namespace Windows::XYZ;
}
is a good idea, which I suspect could introduce identifiers into the winrt namespace that conflict with private identifiers already defined there, which could manifest itself during later template instantiation (although I’m rusty on C++ at this point, so please correct me).

I wonder how do you pronounce HWND?  From your use of the indefinite article “a” it doesn’t look like it’s pronounced as “aitch-double-U-N-D”.

In my head I pronounce that “window handle” 😉

I’ve always pronounced HWND as “h-wind”.

That’s what I always tried to pronounce, but somehow, it always comes out “Aitch-Wound”.
