Since this operation fundamentally (as viewed from the userland) has thread affinity, I’d probably just spin up my own thread to perform it.

This can get expensive if you have 200 objects that all want to monitor registry keys. Are you going to create 200 threads and keep them alive for the lifetime of their respective objects?

I wanted to say I’d create one thread that sits in a loop handing requests from the objects; I’m just not comfortable using a thread pool thread to do this.
