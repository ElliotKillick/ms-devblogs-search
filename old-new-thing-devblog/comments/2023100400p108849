I suspect that there is also often confusion about what it means to make a SID "restricted".
That sounds like it would prevent the process from using that SID to access a secured object.  If I understand correctly, what it actually does is to prevent the process from using any *other* SID to access a secured object - unless that other SID is itself "restricted".

A better terminology would be “restricting”, which the documentation does use in places, but not consistently.  Oh well.

In reply to Raymond:
> It merely says that the first service, in addition to accessing everything that Local Service can access, can also access anything which grants access to the service SID.
It should also deny access to objects denied to the service SID?
I think "restricted SID" means that it can only be used to deny access, not grant --- similar to the fact that an unelevated process started under an administrator account (UAC enabled) has...Read moreIn reply to Raymond:

I think “restricted SID” means that it can only be used to deny access, not grant — similar to the fact that an unelevated process started under an administrator account (UAC enabled) has the Administrators group restricted SID so that it does not have access to anything denied to Administrators.

Yes, that indeed prevents the process from accessing an object using the restricted SID, and it also prevents access by means of any other SID (if the other SID is restricted, then prevention is a no-op since the other SID never grants access in the first place).

No, the deny-only attribute for a SID is different to the restricting SIDs list.
Documentation here:
> The system performs two access checks: one using the token's enabled SIDs, and another using the list of restricting SIDs. Access is granted only if both access checks allow the requested access rights.
Also
> Restricting SIDs are always enabled for access checks.
