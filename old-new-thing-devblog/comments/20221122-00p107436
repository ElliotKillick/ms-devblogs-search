Both of these examples sound like deferring responsibility to me. If there’s a problem, employees need to be straightforward and honest about it so it can get resolved. Sometimes you also have to stand up and go outside your comfort zone to make sure things get resolved. Everyone constantly trying to pass the buck to someone else is how we end up with issues end up lingering on forever.

You come in under schedule, believe it or not jail…
You come in _over_ schedule, also jail.
We have the best schedules in the world, because of jail.
