I ran into this in the days of DOS and VESA BIOS extensions, through not considering the possibility that the same video mode might have a different stride on different video cards.

The settings app in my Windows 10 VM used to do this for the uninstaller icons. Not sure if the cause was the same but it had corruption similar to this.

A classic for anyone who’ve been fiddling with image file formats. Getting the stride wrong is one of the loudest and most obvious errors to make.

I’ve encountered this situation before. At that time, I wanted to store the pixel data of winrt::Windows::Graphics::Capture::Direct3D11CaptureFrame into std::vector, and I only used a single memcpy instruction. Then, I kept wondering why the screenshots my program saved usually turned out like this, but occasionally I was able to get the correct image.”
