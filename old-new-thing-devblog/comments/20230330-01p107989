Ahhh, that takes me back. But the farmification software I wrote ran on Windows CE on a Compaq C-series HPC.
Which, uh, had a LOT less grunt than an iPad. I can’t imagine what sort of farmy stuff they’re doing that needs that much processing.

This is just Wirth's law, which is usually phrased in terms of Moore's law, but I prefer the following formulation: Software expands to fill the available hardware. If your CPU gets twice as fast, the software written for it will be twice as slow (as compared to software written for the previous CPU that wasn't twice as fast). You can see this as a good thing or as a bad thing:
Optimistic take: This is good...Read moreThis is just Wirth’s law, which is usually phrased in terms of Moore’s law, but I prefer the following formulation: Software expands to fill the available hardware. If your CPU gets twice as fast, the software written for it will be twice as slow (as compared to software written for the previous CPU that wasn’t twice as fast). You can see this as a good thing or as a bad thing:
Optimistic take: This is good because it means software engineers can devote more resources to bug fixes and new features, and the market values those things more than performance (within reason). Nobody has to bother with exotic data structures or algorithms because simpler and more easily understood code will still be good enough. This is also a function of using higher-level (slower) languages like Python instead of C++.
Pessimistic take: This is bad because, quite often, the new software doesn’t actually have significant new features or bug fixes, or because those things don’t justify the waste of computing resources. In many cases, this has nothing to do with exotic data structures or algorithms, and is instead a function of breaking very basic rules like “don’t block the UI thread” or “don’t assume the network is fast.”
Which of these takes is more accurate will depend on the specific software and hardware involved.

Granted, I don’t think that this needs true real time processing, but I would think that if you cannot afford for your process to be scheduled out you should use dedicated hardware.

I think the R&D, manufacturing, and reliability costs for “Use an iPad” are much better than “Design and manufacture your own hardware.”

Wait did you mean an actual Apple iPad? That’s hilarious. I thought you just meant it in the sense that there was a screen in the dash instead of gauges. Seems jank

Well, maybe they should have chosen a Windows- or Linux-based platform instead? At least there you can actually instruct the OS to run your app at the highest priority.
