Reminds me of when I used to work for a company called Real Time Financial Management.
I had cause to call a third party help desk.
The girl who answered my call thought it was hilarious that I was calling for help from a company called RTFM.

There’s a commercial truck company called Western Truck Fabricators that brands their work with WTF mudflaps.

As I understand it, Chromium is old enough that there wasn’t (or possibly still isn’t; I’m unfamiliar with the actual code, only its name) enough standard library support for the things they wanted to do in C++, so in 2006 they rolled their own Webkit Template Framework.

My current favourite is everytime someone at work mentions CBT for our product. What they mean is “Computer Based Training”; unfortunately it also has a couple of other meanings…both of which seem appropriate at times.

While that topic is unfortunate enough to only warrant a redirect to “Educational technology”, at least it has secured a top spot on the Wikipedia disambiguation page among other computing terms such as “closed beta-testing” and “complete binary tree”.

Speaking of funny acronyms, I like the one for Command/Query Responsibility Segregation. I pronounce it as “secure ass”.

One of our product is named “Braiding-/Spiral-Monitoring” …so BDSM.exe it is.
Also I love POSReady 2009, that it only recently stopped getting updates. Still have it in a VM for testing because yes, customers have tons of them deployed, often with no near future plan to upgrade or replace.

You just can’t win: some words start off being utterly benign, but develop their bad karma later. A fine example of this is ‘vista’.

And you may want to check with people speaking other languages as well, as with Honda Fitta in Sweden.

When the Zune was about to come out, an email circulated amongst French Canadians asking whether we found it offensive. It does sound like a word we use to refer to a male organ. But the consensus was that it wasn’t particularly offensive. And it was probably too late to change it.

When MS bought Sendit back in ’99, the original name was to be Microsoft Mobile Internet, but someone thought that MSMI could be read out as “A mess, am I” so they changed it to MS MIBU – Mobile Internet Business Unit.
