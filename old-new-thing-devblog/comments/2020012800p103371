In my surrounding everyone pronounces it as “win-de-be-ge”

No-no-no, it’s «виндэбэгэ».

My instinct pronounce it as “wind-bug”…

As I recall, one of the NT debugger devs back then (20+ years ago) hated hearing it called windbag.  But it was too late – we all called it that, probably from the start (mid 90s, if not earlier).

strangely WinDebug is only 8 chars so there was never any need to shrink the name to fit 8.3
That probably mean the internal windbag joke won over common sense:-)

I always liked wind-bag since I first heard it years ago, but generally I opt for win-debug because otherwise people have no idea what I’m talking about.
