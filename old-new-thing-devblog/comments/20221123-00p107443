And this highlights why private inheritance was a mistake.

From the API user's point of view, private base classes are indistinguishable from private member variables. Having private base classes in addition to member variables is still useful not only because it allows more concise and modular code (like using  to selectively expose base class members as public), but also because of properties like empty base optimization (EBO) that was not available to member variables prior to the introduction of .
