It’s practically impossible to keep up with all of these changes in TLD policy around the world
The Public Suffix List is meant to track such things. I wonder if Domain uses that list (albeit an outdated version).

For the same reason the Public Suffix List was created, correct? Couldn’t it maybe retrofitted to use a snapshot of the PSL under the scenes?

ccTLDs are basically a mess. Unfortunately, it's a case of the technology reflecting messy reality, rather than something you can "just fix." Governments want to administer their own domains, for various administrative and political reasons that range from "we don't want our citizens getting scammed by fake government websites" to "if the US government can have .gov and .mil, then we should be allowed to have our own official domains too."

Unfortunately, it’s a case of the technology reflecting messy reality, rather than something you can “just fix.” Governments want to administer their own domains, for various administrative and political reasons that range from “we don’t want our citizens getting scammed by fake government websites” to “if the US government can have .gov and .mil, then we should be allowed to have our own official domains too.” There was probably, at some point, a risk that some countries might resort to implementing alternate DNS roots to get there, which would have seriously fragmented the internet. In the world we live in, a URL is a URL. You can resolve it anywhere in the world (unless your government blocks DNS resolution altogether). In this hypothetical, we would have American URLs and European URLs, or possibly even finer granularity than that, and you would only be able to resolve URLs valid within your country’s system. Some URLs might work internationally, but others might not, and there would be no universal standard, so you’d have to know the recipient’s location to figure out whether the URL is portable. ccTLDs took away most of the motivation for doing that, by giving countries their own little DNS fiefdoms and letting them do whatever they wanted within those fiefdoms (with the understanding that they don’t get to dictate how the rest of the DNS works).
The downside is that, when countries can do whatever they want, they will do whatever they want. So we get co.uk and com.au and all the other arbitrary differences that arise when there are no standards. Incidentally, the very existence of .uk is itself an anomaly, because the official ccTLD for the UK is “supposed” to be .gb. The UK had already implemented a pre-DNS naming scheme with uk at the top level, and the ISO code uk is permanently reserved to avoid confusion (meaning there’s no risk of .uk conflicting with some other country, either now or in the future), so they were allowed to keep it. It’s fortunate that uk was already reserved by ISO – if it had been allocated to e.g. Ukraine, then the geopolitics would have been complicated and probably unpleasant (the ISO list was not designed for internet use – it was designed for postal use, so they probably wouldn’t be happy with revising the list just because IANA painted itself into a corner).

So my initial thought would be that ‘Domain’ is intended to match the web ‘same site’ definition, which uses the Public Suffix List (PSL).
But if that was the case, I would also expect it to get regularly synced with the official list. Which most obviously isn’t the case here, since tec.br was added as a new official SLD in July-2020 !!

There is a Mozilla’s Public Suffix List project specifically for this purpose. On Linux it is typically used via libpsl C library, with the list itself updated separately system-wide, so that applications won’t need to bundle it.

A better question would be “why was Domain created?”
I’m guessing code for the Windows Runtime is not added just because a dev felt like it.
