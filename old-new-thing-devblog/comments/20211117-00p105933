CreateThreadpoolIo fails for me if called multiple times on the same handle even if I call CloseThreadpoolIo in between, which makes no sense to me at all. The only way I was able to deal with it was by never allowing loose handles to participate with the thread pool, and managing the entire handle lifetime in a stream wrapper. I call CreateThreadpoolIo once and only once, and StartThreadpoolIo on every individual operation.

So in the FILE_SKIP_COMPLETION_PORT_ON_SUCCESS case I assume you would want to use result || instead.
