If the issue were another thread accessing the guard page how would you debug this? Since guard page errors seem to be pretty common (at least when the stack is still growing) it could be a high volume event. I was requesting a kernel feature to support ETW instrumentation for every thrown exception but the answer was a simple no. Is there nowadays support for this in the kernel?
