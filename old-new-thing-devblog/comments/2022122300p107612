It’s the same idea Raymond used in his “Creating a co_await awaitable signal that can be awaited multiple times, part 4”.

I thought PostMessage was the real fire-and-forget version, although there are some subtle differences e.g. posted messages get handled by the message pump.

As far as I can tell, PostMessage is ALWAYS fire-and-forget.
SendNotifyMessage behaves like SendMessage if the message is sent to a window belonging to the calling thread. It behaves (somewhat) like PostMessage if it’s a window belonging to a different thread.
I say “somewhat” because I believe the window procedure is still called right away, instead of putting a message in the queue, but it won’t wait for a response before returning to the caller.

I wonder why did NT still use SendMessage instead of SendNotifyMessage for ChangeClipboardChain
