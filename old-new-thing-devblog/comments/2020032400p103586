We had a spookier one.
    var find = Wrd.Selections.Find;
    find.Text = “@@@”;
    find.Execute(); /* Fails with System.InvalidCastException only on some computers */
but
    dynamic find = Wrd.Selections.Find;
    find.Text = “@@@”;
    find.Execute(); /* Works where the other one fails */
Good luck explaining that.

Does the language projection try to cache a descendant interface? For example, the object is initially created with ILauncherOptions interface, then upon the first successful QueryInterface to ILauncherOptions2, the implementation uses that as the internal interface pointer.
For the solution, I suppose you could check the API contract beforehand or use C++/WinRT “as”.
