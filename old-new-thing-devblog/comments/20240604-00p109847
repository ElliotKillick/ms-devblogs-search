Q61285 does shed some light on why there hasn’t been a problem for the last 30 years because apparently GlobalLock and GlobalUnlock don’t actually change the lock count on most global memory allocations anyway.

> Despite being obsolete for decades, 32-bit and 64-bit Windows still support the GlobalLock and GlobalUnlock functions for backward compatibility. You can allocate memory with the GMEM_MOVEABLE [sic] flag, which allocates a handle, and then call GlobalLock to lock the handle and produce a pointer, and so on, programming like it’s 1984.
Are there better ways for accessing the Clipboard, where the documentation seems to suggest the use of GlobalLock and GMEM_MOVEABLE etc.:

The other use of GlobalLock would be to defragment your 32-bit address space.
But the need for that went away with 64-bit applications.
