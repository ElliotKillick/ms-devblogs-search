As much as the love optimized code I suspect this particular optimization does very little good on modern processors which could probably search any sized list control in the blink of an eye no matter what method was used. Perhaps the modern choice should be to not set the list of style  at all?

Even on a 4GHz CPU you gotta respect big-O especially in UI code which is thread-bound. If multiple real-time updates are happening on the thread then you can gum everything up really quick especially in XAML world with sort columns and reflection.

Respect, but verify. If your listbox has more than lets say 2000 elements itâ€™s gotta be an extreme outlier and probably a UI fail. And <2000 elements, how long would it take to just do a linear search?
