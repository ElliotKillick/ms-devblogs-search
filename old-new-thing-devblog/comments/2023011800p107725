I usually don't like to get involved with stuff that I don't fully understand, but in this case I'll try to play the devil's dumb advocate: what if the Contoso app is misconfigured and it always wants to run with elevated privileges?

The user is accustomed to just clicking OK on the security prompt because they trust the application. Even if they are not accustomed to clicking OK, they might just shrug it off as a hiccup after an automatic update and ignore it anyway. The user might be a lot more careful with an unknown script or application placed in the Startup folder (which does not benefit from automatic elevation, IIRC).
In this specific case, being able to place random plugins or specially crafted commands in a user-writable folder allows running malicious code with elevated privileges, or am I wrong? The owner of the Contoso application should at least be notified, to tighten up the permissions or stop loading executable code from a non-secure folder.

Right, in that case, it could be a privilege elevation vulnerability in Contoso. But given the wording of the report, I don't think it is the case: if it were, the reporter would have noted it. Anyhow, I think replying the reporter in that way would solve it: the ball would be again in their field, and if there were an elevation of privilege, s/he would be able to reply telling it.
That said, the attacker...Read moreRight, in that case, it could be a privilege elevation vulnerability in Contoso.

That said, the attacker and the victim does not have to be the same person. An admin has access to every other user‚Äôs files, so it can ‚Äúattack‚Äù other accounts. But even in this case, it wouldn‚Äôt be a vulnerability (‚Äúbeing an admin leads to control over non-admin users‚Äù üòõ ).

You're still attacking yourself though. You modified the config file and you have permission to elevate the executable, so you aren't doing anything you couldn't do anyway since if you can run Contsoso.exe elevated you could run malware.bat elevated if you chose to.
If the contoso.exe had installed a system service that read it's plugin config from an unprotected directory, then an unprivileged user could cause plugins to be loaded with higher permissions than the user...Read moreYou‚Äôre still attacking yourself though.

Requiring that the plug-in be in a secure folder doesn't help. (1) Most users want to use plug-ins without requiring admin privileges. Imagine if you had to be admin to install a browser plug-in. (2) The executable in this case is indeed in a secure folder. It's a system DLL that is being repurposed by the attacker. In order to carry out this attack, you must have already gained file planting access to the user,...Read moreRequiring that the plug-in be in a secure folder doesn‚Äôt help.
