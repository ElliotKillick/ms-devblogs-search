Could be worse. They could name things that provide no actual indication of anything useful (what it does, what it represents, etc). Entra comes to mind‚Ä¶

Could be worse still, wasn‚Äôt it called Azure Active Directory while having nothing in common (nor possible to interoperate) with ‚Äúreal‚Äù AD?

All I care is that they are named in Pascal Case otherwise it‚Äôs not much easier to read than assembly language. That was always the big problem I had with the C/C++ world, their naming conventions are like every byte costs big money and it is always unnecessarily difficult to quickly see what a chunk of code is doing.

Actually C++ these days have ridiculously long identifiers spelt in full in its standard library like  and , and they're all in snake_case, which costs more bytes than PascalCase.
The C standard library on the other hand is still stuck with short, abbreviated symbols (), which ironically makes less sense in C than in C++ because C doesn't have namespaces and is much more prone to naming conflicts. The broader C community makes more sense...Read moreActually C++ these days have ridiculously long identifiers spelt in full in its standard library like hardware_constructive_interference_size and atomic_compare_exchange_strong_explicit, and they‚Äôre all in snake_case, which costs more bytes than PascalCase.

The broader C community makes more sense and uses long, prefixed identifiers with discipline.

I‚Äôve met many programmers in my life, and each one of them assured me that THEY know how to name things. It‚Äôs everybody else who doesn‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing.

Naming things is one of the two hard problems in computer science.

Alongside cache invalidation and off by one errors, right?

container .empty() / .clear() are one of my workmate‚Äôs favourite gripes about naming.

libc++ marks its vector‚Äòs empty method as nodiscard, so you‚Äôll get a warning if you mistake it for clear. I haven‚Äôt checked other containers or other standard library impls.

if only we were still using LISP we‚Äôd know for sure the function should have been named emptyp,  and ‚Ä¶.
 caarnilmap ?
üòâ
just kidding mostly, but adding p to all predicate functions was a good, almost Hungarian convention.

Fun pairing I‚Äôve seen in two parts of a big codebase: one group of collections used
bool empty() const; void clear();
 as its naming convention, while another group used
bool is_empty() const; void empty();
.
