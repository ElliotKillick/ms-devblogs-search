“… copy elision rule …” – is copy elison now required by The Language in this case, or is this still at the discretion of the compiler?

Copy elision in C++17 and later is an intuitive way to say “initialization by prvalue”.  You can read tartanllama’s article “Guaranteed Copy Elision Does Not Elide Copies” if you want to dive deeper.
If you’re not striving to be a language lawyer, then yes, copy elision from C++17 onwards is mandatory regardless of optimization.
