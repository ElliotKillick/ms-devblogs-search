Does “safe mode” count as other/different OS?
Safe mode enables the builtin “Administrator” account (which has NO password set out of the box) if no other local user account is member of the “Administrators” group.
And what about the “recovery environment” installed with every Windows since Vista?
Thanks to this no “evil maid” needs to carry her own custom boot medium with her…

For the record, if you somehow have the ability to set the boot medium but not the ability to reboot the system, there is a privilege controlling that command.

Indeed. My organization thinks bitlocker protects against non-admin user with physical access to the laptop. I wouldn’t put too many bets on “there’s no way they could possibly get the bitlocker recovery key”.

Is there any way to get MSRC to migrate that list to a stable, maintained static web page for all eternity? Potentially add in things like “Accessing a ‘secure’ VM from an insecure machine won’t save you” (TBF this is still effectively #2).
