Should actually be “vtable + (index * sizeof(FARPROC)), sizeof(FARPROC)” ?

No; the type of vtable is FARPROC*, so the offsets in pointer arithmetic are automatically scaled.
If instead the function had been declared as
BOOL ReplaceVtableEntry(char *vtable, int index, FARPROC replacement, FARPROC *previousFunction)
 then yes, multiplying by the size of FARPROC would have been necessary.

Thanks for the explanation, I remember seeing similar crash dialogs like this and wondering why the even numbered addresses e.g. xxxxxx5000. now I know.
