I followed the first tutorial on this page: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winauto/uiauto-howto-implement-event-handlers
A bunch of exceptions were thrown:
mincore\com\oleaut32\dispatch\ups.cpp(2126)\OLEAUT32.dll!00007FF80C9E1924: (caller: 00007FF80C9E1A5A) ReturnHr(1) tid(ada8) 8002801D Library not registered
I put a breakpoint in the QueryInterface part and noticed the query was for an INoMarshal. After adding the interface to the class the exceptions stopped and it the debug output looks clean. However, I am getting E_NOINTERFACE (0x80004021). I noticed someone provided a link (Why do I get E_NOINTERFACE when creating an object that supports that interface) but I have yet to find it.
Is there an interface for INoMarshal?
Any help is appreciated.

Shouldn’t Unmarshaling a weak reference gracefully fail if the marshaled object has been destroyed?

And how would the code detect that this has happened, so it can fail gracefully? The weak reference is just a raw pointer.

Sounds like a plain pointer isn’t good enough for weak references then. As such, this implementation shouldn’t have allowed the marshalling step to succeed in the first place.

The ReleaseMarshalData method never seem to be called when I’m testing custom marshaling. Any advise on how to trigger calls to ReleaseMarshalData so that the implementation can be tested?
