Sounds a bit like the (possibly apocryphal) story that a version of Word Perfect was shipped to customers in “debug” mode because every attempt to make a release build with optimization and NOPed asserts or whatever was too unstable.
Luckily with modern automated testing techniques that kind of thing would *never* happen today.

I expect that the video driver must use a completely isolated heap.  No?

With GPU drivers things are bit more complex due to performance requirement. Driver is split into two parts. Kernel-mode and user-mode. User-mode gets loaded into (almost) each process and handles graphical calls. They are separate copies, so they are independent. That’s why certain DirectX calls can be in the end simple wrappers around memcpy(-like).
of course this is still a lot simplified description, but I hope it suffices and is clear.

I guess some data is better kept in the client process. Perhaps this is why the Vulkan API lets you provide an allocator for the driver to use.
