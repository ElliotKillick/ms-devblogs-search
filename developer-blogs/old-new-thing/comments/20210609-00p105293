In
bfc     r0, r0, #18, #13    ; r0 = r0 & 0x00003FFF
don’t you have the lsb and number of bits backwards? And shouldn’t it be #14?
bfc     r0, r0, #14, #18    ; r0 = r0 & 0x00003FFF

I think the constants in the
and r0, r0, #0x0003FFFF ; not a valid instruction
 and
bfc r0, r0, #14, #18    ; r0 = r0 & 0x00003FFF
 instructions are still mismatched (0x3FFF vs. 0x3FFFF).
