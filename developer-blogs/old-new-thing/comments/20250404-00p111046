What’s footnote 1? I see “¹” in the text, but I’m having trouble finding what it’s referring to.

Oops. I’ll make a new article for what used to be the footnote.

I'm not familiar with std::optional but I don't know how I feel about bool and dereference operators being used to mean "has a value" and "get the value".  I guess it sort of makes sense semantically, but if you just read that line, it looks an awful lot like earliest is just a ulong pointer and not an object.  Maybe that's the... point? (I'll show myself out) but I think I prefer using explicit methods to interact with the optional type over this level of terseness.  Is this style considered idiomatic in most modern C++?

You meant ”assassinating”, right?
P.S. God punish those unable to fix the commenting feature.

Once I was a C++ developer, now I barely understand a line of this code. It’s fascinating how C++ has changed!
