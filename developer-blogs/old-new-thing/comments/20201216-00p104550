Yes, Since Windows 10 1607 / Server2016. However, it’s only one nesting level, unlike System/360.

360 virtualization: Melinda Varian documented some of this history. The following happened circa 1970:
When [Alain] Auroux started, Cambridge was running a 360/67, not a S/370, and that 67 was a production system, so he had to avoid destabilizing it. “Vanilla” CP-67 systems created System/360 virtual machines, but they did not virtualize the 360/67; that is, they did not allow a guest to create its own virtual storage. Auroux’s first step was to modify CP-67 to create virtual 360/67s, which used 4K pages and 1M segments. Once he had convinced the Cambridge Operations Manager to run that as the production system,...Read more360 virtualization: Melinda Varian documented some of this history.

When [Alain] Auroux started, Cambridge was running a 360/67, not a S/370, and that 67 was a production system, so he had to avoid destabilizing it. “Vanilla” CP-67 systems created System/360 virtual machines, but they did not virtualize the 360/67; that is, they did not allow a guest to create its own virtual storage. Auroux’s first step was to modify CP-67 to create virtual 360/67s, which used 4K pages and 1M segments. Once he had convinced the Cambridge Operations Manager to run that as the production system, he could then proceed to develop a CP-67 that virtualized the System/370 architecture.
The System/370 relocation architecture was different from the 360/67 architecture; it allowed both 2K and 4K pages and both 64K and 1M segments. So, Auroux modified his modified CP-67 to support 64K segments and the new System/370 instructions. He ran that system second-level, so he could run a virtual S/370 third-level. He developed a prototype “CP-370” in that third-level virtual machine. Then, to test this CP-370’s virtualization of System/370 virtual memory, he had to run it both third- and fourth-level, with a couple of CMS machines running fifth-level. He remembers doing much of his testing from home at night using an “old, slow, noisy teletype”.
