The social media floor doesn’t seem to fit the progression.  Networking was the next big technological advancement in computing.  (Once again Microsoft misses the boat on the internet!)  Sure, social media is enabled by networking, but it’s not really representative of it.  I’m cool with cloud computing.  When they add a seventh floor, I wonder whether it’ll be quantum computing or AI.  Then again, if the AI wins, there probably won’t be enough people left to justify the six floors already there. 😉
