“and I notice that the window is now visible, so I must be printing”
You probably meant to say “hidden” instead of “visible”?

Begun, has the window visibility war.
Or rather, the escalation with ill-behaved app continues.
- I wish to complain about this window what I created not half an hour ago from this very desktop.
- What's wrong with it?
- I'll tell you what's wrong with it, my lad. 'E's not visible, that's what's wrong with it!
- No, no, 'e's uh,...he's painting.
- Look, matey, I know an invisible window when I don't see one, and I'm not looking at one right now.

>since the concept didn’t exist at the time they were written.
What about new apps?

Thanks for sharing this with us, your use-case hits the nail on the head for me... I work on Greenshot, which in fact does EXACTLY what you describe in the first paragraph.
We have some reported issues from people who are not being able to select certain windows as Greenshot thinks that another is in front, but it's not visible. We could not explain this until now... I hope, let's see if this fixes the issue. It might actually be virtual desktop related, I just never used them so I should definitively do some testing with it.

It’s actually always a fun challenge to keep things working, with all the “workarounds” Windows has 😉

Greenshot is great! I’ve encountered that issue with Greenshot too, on occasion. Glad it will be fixed now!

This seems to fix the issue, thanks for reporting it!
If windows are on a different virtual desktop, they are cloaked. But somehow there are also other windows, I believe the search is one, which are cloaked.
Btw. I started building an OSS library to make the Greenshot development a bit easier.
It's for .NET Framework and dotnet core and handles a lot of Win32 complexity, it gives a more modern API for some older concepts: https://github.com/dapplo/Dapplo.Windows
Enumerating visible windows is one of them, Dwm support too.. The shell is somehow under represented.

Another thanks for the excellent Greenshot! I’ll have to check your library out at some point too. 🙂

“But the plans were on display…”
“On display? I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find them.”
“That’s the display department.”
“With a flashlight.”
“Ah, well, the lights had probably gone.”
“So had the stairs.”
“But look, you found the notice, didn’t you?”
“Yes,” said Arthur, “yes I did. It was on display in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying ‘Beware of the Leopard.”

I thought cloaking technology was prohibited by the Treaty of Algeron?

Honestly I can’t find a reason when this would be useful unless an app does CPU/GPU potentially intensive things while getting WM_PAINT messages and wants to be nice when it’s not actually visible. In most other cases the app should probably take the “Blissfully unaware” tactic and just let the OS do its thing.

I gave an example in the opening paragraph. Consider a teleconferencing app that has an “app sharing” feature, and it says “Click on the app you want to share”, and you click on Excel, but the teleconferencing app mistakenly believes that you clicked on the WoW game on your “gaming” virtual desktop.

Many apps do. For instance, video apps such as Windows Media Player stop rendering video when invisible.

And that’s why MS was able to get it working well when nobody else could. It isn’t shell functionality. It’s window manager functionality.

I remember under the previous version of https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20180501-00/?p=98645 (or another), someone said only MS can hide a window in some undocumented way without removing WM_VISIBLE, and Raymond replied that it was done in a documented way, by cloaking.
