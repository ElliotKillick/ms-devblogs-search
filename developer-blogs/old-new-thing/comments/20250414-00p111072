At the same time, how many windows users understand that a shortcut can run arbitrary commands and isn't just a link (or rather,  .lnk) to what's on the hard drive? Perhaps the term paper could have been better written but I think there's a valid concern here in that just slapping a warning on every file downloaded (which windows does already, Ad infinitum) results in a bit of "just hit ok" fatigue where malicious intent can easily slip by.

I’d bet my hundred dollars, this was someone from our university technical department. They used to require paper statements to create accounts for employees with password the employee wants to use written open, but recently they’ve changed their policy. Now my password must consist of multiple-cased letters, digits, punctuation, pieces of Mongolian vertical script, extracts from Shakespeare and Omar Khayyam, Base64-encoded MIDI file of Mozart’s Symphony No. 40, hex dump of my JPEG photo reencoded into animated 5-frame GIF and packed with ARJ, and SHA512 hash of a scanned version of my signature, salted with my DNA.
