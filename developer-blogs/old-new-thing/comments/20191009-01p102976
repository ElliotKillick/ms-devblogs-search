I went out to Youtube looking for videos after reading this, and found two dated yesterday:  one a highlights reel of a pro tournament, and the other a 12-hour livestream of a different tournament.  It was interesting to see the differences; the former's players were all athletic-looking guys wearing professional uniforms, and the play field was very small--probably less than 30 feet square, and indoors.  Each side's entire zone was basically about 12 feet deep from the midline to the end line, with the baulk line halfway between, and the bonus line somewhat closer to the baulk...Read moreI went out to Youtube looking for videos after reading this, and found two dated yesterday:  one a highlights reel of a pro tournament, and the other a 12-hour livestream of a different tournament.  It was interesting to see the differences; the former’s players were all athletic-looking guys wearing professional uniforms, and the play field was very small–probably less than 30 feet square, and indoors.  Each side’s entire zone was basically about 12 feet deep from the midline to the end line, with the baulk line halfway between, and the bonus line somewhat closer to the baulk line than the end line, and the lobbies were probably only 4-6 feet wide.  The other was very different–just a bunch of guys in shorts, many not looking particularly athletic, and the field was very different–much larger, and just a dirt field with chalked lines.  There were a bunch of shots of the antis holding hands, and some shots of three or even four players holding hands (actually it looked like one man would hold the next’s elbow)–in those cases, the raider feinted to try to break up the formation.  That game looked like it was probably more challenging because of the much larger field, meaning a lot more running.
Also, I didn’t hear the raider chanting, but in the pro game the audience did it.  Also, both games were obviously narrated in an Indian language (I don’t know what they were speaking but the screen text looked like Devanagari) but the pro game frequently had an announcer give scores in English (“Three points!”) but I didn’t hear much of that in the other one.

"For a raid to be valid, the raider must cross the baulk line". Is that the raiders' side or the antis' side? I'm guessing the raiders, because of the note on "If the former raider is inattentive and lingers near the mid line, the new raider can sneakily touch the former raider and return", which would imply the raider reaches over and taps them, and runs back to their side - without going deep into enemy territory. But crossing the opponent's baulk line seems to make more sense generally, outside that note. So not having seen this in action, 'sneakily'...Read more“For a raid to be valid, the raider must cross the baulk line”. Is that the raiders’ side or the antis’ side?

All action takes place in the anti’s half of the court. Crossing your own baulk line is no challenge at all. The challenge is invading the enemy’s territory. The “sneaky touch” is an exception to the “must cross the baulk line” rule.
