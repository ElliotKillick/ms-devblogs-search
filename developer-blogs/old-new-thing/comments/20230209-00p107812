Assuming the anchor process is a process you control, all it will do is to wait for your process to exit, so it doesn’t matter that it starts before you’re able to put it into the job.

I get the theoretical allure of Job Objects, but I’ve always been wondering who’s using them for what exactly, because in the end we never saw the need for them.
Are they used in Windows / MS components extensively?
Aside: Anyone knows if you can see Job info in the Sysinternals Process Explorer tool?

I used them to ensure that all child processes were terminated if the top-level process that was responsible for handling their lifetime terminated unintentionally. Very handy.
Visual Studio also puts processes it starts under debug into a job, not sure why though.

Silos, the internal representation of chroot style virtualization (whatever the marketing team calls it this week), are extended job objects.

A) Wait for grandchildren. First used by Add/Remove programs in Win2000.
B) Constrain process resources and security. Used by web browsers, UWP and many other things.
C) Kill your worker children if your main process dies.
Process Explorer knows if a process is in a job but it can’t display the job attributes in all cases.
