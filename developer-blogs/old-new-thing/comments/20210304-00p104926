I wish you had generic contact info…
Care to update blog post https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/?p=24863 about how to get the application switcher windows? Things changed quite a lot with Windows 10 and especially annoying appx packages which do all kind of things for which the win32 api did not get updated (visibility?)…

Raymond indicated in that posting that “[t]he details of this algorithm are an implementation detail. It can change at any time, so don’t rely on it. In fact, it already changed with Flip and Flip3D; I’m just talking about the Classic Alt+Tab window here.” and that a couple of window styles could mess with his posted algorithm even back then. I would look at the post as historical trivia from almost 15(!) years ago.

I presume that `fifo = reverse->next;` should be `fifo = fifo->next;` (there’s no variable named `reverse`).
My inclination would be to keep a pointer to the tail of the list and append new waiters to the end, rather than prepending them to the front, to avoid the need to reverse the list.  I suppose that will be what’s coming tomorrow.
