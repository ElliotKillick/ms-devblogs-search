“nobody asked for a shorthand ” it is not really a shorthand IMO, it is a failover. and having multiple failovers…then you get into fights over failover priority… so thank godness it stopped with this single failover.

Agreed.  Name resolution is hard.
Back in the Delphi / pascal days, just changing the order of files in your using clause (used in interface & implementation sections of the file) would change the order of imports of functions, and thus possibly affect your code in subtle ways.
It was used (abused?) to allow overrides of functions by putting your own super version of some library routines first in the using clause so its versions would be used ahead of those from the library.  Mainly applied when not using OO/class style programming

This seems a lot like one of those little features you add that seems like a good idea at the time but then it catches people by surprise and causes confusion later.
