There is also SM_GamesName which would have been nice if it was documented so that all 3rd-party games could put their shortcuts there.
Why did Microsoft not create CSIDL/special folder constants for these? Would have helped with the clutter in the old start menu era.

Now I‚Äôm very curious what SM_AccessoriesName registry key was for, but my very cursory web search yielded no results.

Caution:  I searched for SM_AccessoriesName and got a bunch of shopping results for S&M accessories.

says that ‚ÄúSM_AccessoriesName‚Äù contained the name of the ‚ÄúAccessories‚Äù group on the start menu.  Sounds logical, but it‚Äôs non-canonical of course.

"and for the 64-bit release of Windows, we finally were able to get rid of it in some circumstances."
Just a theory, but since 64-bit (I presume this is x64/AMD64) Windows XP does exist, and given that Windows XP has hard-coded names when it comes into folders (like in this exact example, in German it is "Zubeh√∂r" instead of "Accessories"), it makes perfect sense... unless you remembered that APIs exist :)
Now if some application needs this key,  I presume they just shim it to the value "Accessories" since Windows Vista has overhauled the handling of the locali(z/s)ation.

Now I‚Äôm really curious as to what the third-party software that absolutely needed this was, and why!

‚ÄúAbsolutely needed‚Äù? nothing.  ‚ÄúGot their program to work by grabbing a value from a random undocumented registry key that happened to be this one instead of reading the manual and doing things the recommended way‚Äù?  I‚Äôve got a guess.

Me too, ha!  But remember everyone (not you sir but the future reader) ground rules are no written guesses, we will have to be content with wondering in our hearts.

There was one major piece of software that wanted to duplicate much of the Start Menu internally so many other programs could be launched without having to navigate the Start Menu. That program would do its own tasks that it was intended to do plus act as a shell replacement. Made sense as a design philosophy for DOS applications where switching was difficult; might not have been as useful under Windows.
