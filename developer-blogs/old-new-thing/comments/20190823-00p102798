Probably I’m missing something, but couldn’t the sequence

mov #64,r2 ; r2 = _IOSTRG
and r2,r3 ; r3 = stream->_flag & _IOSTRG
tst r3,r3 ; is it zero?
become more simply
tst #64,r3 ; T = ((stream->flag & _IOSTRG) == 0)
?

Unfortunately, tst with an immediate is available only for r0. But yeah, it looks like we could fix this by changing the preceding mov.l @(12,r9),r3 to mov.l @(12,r9),r0, and that lights up the tst #64,r0.
