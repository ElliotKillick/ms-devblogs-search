“The pointers in the TOKEN_GROUPS_AND_PRIVILEGES certainly cannot point into the token’s internal data structures, because the token is a kernel object, and therefore even if you had a pointer directly into that internal data, you couldn’t access it because kernel pointers are not usable from user mode.”

There is only one system time. You can create as many tokens as you want (up to the memory and/or handle table limit).
