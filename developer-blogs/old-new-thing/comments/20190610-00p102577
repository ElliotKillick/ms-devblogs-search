Why is there not similar define for the SDK headers? Having to do #ifdef SOMESHELLFLAG is a nightmare to keep track of SDK versions and WINVER guards gets in the way.

Because reliance on version number is not sustainable in the long run. When you check `__cplusplus_winrt`, donâ€™t compare its value to 201009.

I agree in theory but you canâ€™t check if a enum exists in a #if etc. __cplusplus_winrt is a number because we are going to compare against it. Presumably at some point we can do: #if __cplusplus_winrt >= 20420101 use featureX.
