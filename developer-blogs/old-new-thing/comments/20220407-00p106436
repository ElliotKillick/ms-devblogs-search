When you start Binging it, it’s amazing how many people’s lives are worse off because the EU said Windows N must exist.

I seem to remember that a manually installed Media Feature Pack becomes missing again after a Windows update and then requires re-installation.

Rule 0: The customer lies, even if they don’t know it.

Rule 0: Don’t assume anything. What may technically be wrong information or a lie as you put it is the reality as the customer sees it. Ask question, check (especially with people who say they are tech savy).

If you think a customer didn’t plug something in correctly, don’t simply ask them to check the connection.  Ask them to unplug it, blow the dust out of the connector, and plug it back in.

Similarly, don’t ask them to check that an Ethernet, USB-C, or other symmetric cable is OK – ask them to swap the two plugs over. This gives the customer a chance to notice that the cable is physically broken, as they pull it out of wherever it’s hidden and switch it round.
Saved me quite a lot of time (when combined with technobabble for why this was needed) doing customer support – the number of people who’d discover that (e.g.) the cable had been cut in two during a move was considerable.

Rule 0.1: if you want to double-check what the customer is telling you, they will call *you* a liar.
