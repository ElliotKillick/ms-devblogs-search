The good news is that as this is a compilation error, you won’t do something silly like this JavaScript example:
async function async_foo() {
  try {
    return async_bar();
  } catch (ex) {
    // try to do something about ex
  }
}
Here the missing await makes a world of difference.

co_await DoSomethingAsync() and return DoSomethingAsync(); aren’t exactly equivalent even in the first example due to the different ways exceptions thrown by code executed before the co_await gets handled.  In Haskell’s type system that would mean the difference between an EitherT Error Async () and an Either Error (Async ()).  And also adjusted_value‘s lifetime issue.
