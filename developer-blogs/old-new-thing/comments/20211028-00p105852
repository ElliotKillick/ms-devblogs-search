Also note that (if I’m not mistaken) the problem stems from the fact that we’re overriding QueryInterface, AddRef and Release in the most-derived Widget class, and so using either WRL or C++/WinRT to implement Widget solves the problem automatically.

Not sure how that helps. Both WRL and C++/WinRT implement QueryInterface, AddRef, and Release in the most-derived class.

struct Widget
    : winrt::implements<Widget, IWidget>,
      CallbackWrapper</* ... */>
{ /* ... */ };

Aren’t QueryInterface etc. implemented in winrt::implements<Widget, IWidget> instead of Widget?  (ATL does seem to implement them in the most derived class if I’ve read ATL’s docs correctly)
