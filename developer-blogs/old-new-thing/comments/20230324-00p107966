It’s not my fault the only way to ungroup icons in the Taskbar is installing sketchy 3rd-party software. I bet someone got a really nice bonus for forcing the taskbar grouping on everyone.

Not just this article, but far too often when articles such as this are written, about widely used 3rd party tweaks, and the commenting strongly supports the tweak in question, but MS charges forward that “all these enthusiasts are wrong, we will continue our way” is telling of how far out of touch the Win dev team is away from its user base.

If this is a serious problem, it could be solved by:
1. having an alternate version of explorer (e.g. called axplorer.exe) which doesn't load 3rd party shell extensions or any other DLLs that aren't included with Windows.
2. having userinit (or whatever launches explorer, maybe winlogon?) detect when explorer crashes, and if it crashes more than a particular number of times in a given time frame, load the alternate version and display a dialog to the user explaining why all their shell extensions are not working anymore.
I believe explorer already restarts when it crashes in newer versions of Windows (8 onwards)...Read moreIf this is a serious problem, it could be solved by:

If only these programs used normal shell extension mechanisms. But no, they patch the shell by nefarious means.

There are no shell extension points for the taskbar/desktop part of Explorer. Deskbars are dead and all other extension points are connected to the file browser and IShellView/IShellFolder.

But how do they get into the explorer.exe address space initially ? Do they load as extension and then break all the rules and start directly patching them ? Maybe you could reveal some tacticss they use and why said tactics are not good, maybe even tell how to do patching correctly ? This could be a new series articles like “the good,bad and ugly of shell patching”

They don’t use the shell extension mechanism to get into the process. They sneak in by nefarious means. Patching is not supported. There is no “correct” way of doing it. Just different levels of bad.

“Just different levels of bad.” I think you said that about me at one point. [grin]

The taskbar’s also pretty bad. Maybe if it were disconnected from the file browser and from the UWP launcher your patching headaches would be much reduced.

Some would consider having to deal with the primitive COM tooling for shell extensions equally bad.

Easiest fix for these issues is to dedicate some poor guy at explorer team to be a user of all those shell enchancement (pun intended) softwares.

There’s at least one such utility out there that properly enough validates if their patches would work, or blocklist specific Windows builds known to break from it completely. I wish the other very-obvious-from-your-article software would do so too.

Is there an argument for developing something else to bootstrap the basic desktop experience, instead of Explorer -- i.e. something that can't be patched/doesn't have extension support -- and having Explorer be a regular desktop app?
I'm thinking something like the old days of Progman: without it you didn't have the Windows experience most people were used to, you just had the cyan desktop that didn't do very much.  I guess I'm also thinking of the difference between a Linux distro's desktop environment vs its window manager.

Would that “solve” the problem of extending Explorer?  You could at least sign and/or validate it before any user code ran (maybe via UEFI/SecureBoot?)
(I suppose, given both Server Core and RemoteApps exist — or even the OOBE — at least some of this idea already exists.)
What do you see as the bare-minimum that Windows would need from such a bootstrapper?  What additional problems might it introduce?

They could use out of process modern IPC like in Android, macOS/iOS (XPC), Linux (DBUS), instead of in-process COM, with tooling that has hardly changed the last 25 years.

What would that bootstrapper help with, exactly? What would its responsibiilties be? The actual bootstrapper is userinit.exe, but without explorer.exe, Windows is quite useless (but you can still do things in apps you have open, or launch Task Manager to bring Explorer back). Windows could prevent third-party DLLs from loading, but the very loud community of such patchers would yell “Microsoft is evil, they’re locking down Windows and forcing you to have the taskbar at the botom”. Windows could split explorer.exe into files.exe, taskbar.exe, and desktop.exe, but the patcher community would probably just patch and cause crashes in three processes...Read moreWhat would that bootstrapper help with, exactly?

"but without explorer.exe, Windows is quite useless (but you can still do things in apps you have open, or launch Task Manager to bring Explorer back)"
Actually, only if Explorer is not there, not if it crashed/hung.
I sometimes have a problem where Edge somehow blocks explorer.exe.
It still runs but clicking on things does nothing.
If you press Ctrl+Alt+Del and select Task Manager then the Ctrl+Alt+Del-screen goes a away but you get no task manager.
But if it was already running and visible, the killing Edge, then Explorer and restarting Explorer gets you a useable PC again.

This reminds me of MS08-067 where they used strsafe (for NT5) when a simpler fix would have sufficed.

These “Explorer patchers” have no choice, as the normal Explorer in WIndows 11 has lost so much – I’m looking at you, Taskbar!
If MS would only *add* new features and doesn’t remove useful features, all will be well.

While I don’t usually like to say this, this time, I have to agree. The shell has lost a lot of features in Windows 11 and this is the only real way to get some useful features back at the moment.
It is MS’s fault these programs exist and are used widely enough to cause big spikes in the statistics. There have been posts made by major news sites about how to use these programs.

Or they could provide appropriate hooking APIs for the need of such extensions.

Quite right unfortunately. Since swapping out explorer as the shell doesn’t work anymore we are forced into terrible choices.
I really do want to be able to run cmd.exe or something even more radical as the shell and still open uwp applications; but this just doesn’t work.

Indeed. There wouldn’t be as much of a need if the windows shell team was smarter. As it stands they make the world a worse place each day they exist. If they feel like imposters, it’s because they are.
In fact I actively encourage, support, and celebrate efforts like this. Make their life hell and delay them. If they spend more time on investigating issues like this, they’ll have less time to f**k something else up.
