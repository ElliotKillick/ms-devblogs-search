So, does it help for yesterday‚Äôs blogpost error for which net helpmsg does not work?
> certutil /error 0x80070bfe
0x80070bfe (WIN32: 3070) -- 2147945470 (-2147021826)
Error message text: memory

> certutil /error 0x80070bfd
0x80070bfd (WIN32: 3069) -- 2147945469 (-2147021827)
Error message text: Error 0x80070bfd (WIN32: 3069)

Nope. So, I wonder ‚Äì where do the error messages quoted yesterday come from?

I prefer err.exe, but if you have to stick to the built-in tools, then it sounds like certutil is good way to go.  I had no idea that it could look up error codes.

Certutil is also handy if you‚Äôre looking for a way to get a hash of a file (to validate a download or the like)
certutil -hashfile file.txt sha256
I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôve used certutil a lot more often for things completely unrelated to certs than for anything related to them.

All error codes are HRESULTs?
NTSTATUS codes ain‚Äôt, for example!

NTSTATUS codes can be encoded as HRESULT values, though. Just like Win32 system error codes. Uniquely identifiable as such, too. While indeed not every error code is in fact an HRESULT, every error code in Windows can be encoded as an HRESULT.
