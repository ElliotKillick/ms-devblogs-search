This kind of issues are still very much present in today's storage servers. I work for a company who specializes in Acoustic simulation and we help some customers to avoid having resonances create reading / writing problems in hard drives. The source of the noise / vibrations is often the cooling fan as companies are trying to compact more and more hard drives in the same volume, putting more constraint on the power for the fan to ensure thermal performances. You can read more here if interested, it's a short article explaining how Meta deals with this kind of issues:...Read moreThis kind of issues are still very much present in today’s storage servers.

I guess they were lucky in the recording studio that none of their machines had such drives. That would be some support call:  “Every time we try and record this song all our machines crash!”  I can just imagine that support call to Microsoft.

There is also the story of the resonant frequency of chicken skulls from the old Borland Turbo C++ documentation:
https://everything2.com/title/7+hertz+-+the+resonant+frequency+of+a+chicken%2527s+skull
Quote:
True story: 7 Hz is the resonant
frequency of a chicken’s skull cavity.
This was determined empirically in
Australia, where a new factory
generating 7-Hz tones was located too
close to a chicken ranch: When the
factory started up, all the chickens
died.

Why did they ruined the audio instead of making proper isolation for hard drives though? Filtering out frequencies from the audio without user’s consent because of crappy hardware is a very ugly workaround. And laptops can still be crashed by malicious actor using other audio devices.

Mr. Chen, could you please clarify if your colleague in Windows XP product support witnessed this or if this is one of those urban legends that happened to "a friend of a friend". Also, I'm wondering how you feel about CVE 2022-38392 which is entirely based on this blog entry. While it is hilarious to think that Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation is a Denial of Service attack, it seems almost preposterous that a laptop could be that shoddily built. Did they not have proper damping of vibrations?
That said, I did analyze the frequency spectrum using Audacity and the most prominent...Read moreMr. Chen, could you please clarify if your colleague in Windows XP product support witnessed this or if this is one of those urban legends that happened to “a friend of a friend”.

While it is hilarious to think that Janet Jackson’s Rhythm Nation is a Denial of Service attack, it seems almost preposterous that a laptop could be that shoddily built. Did they not have proper damping of vibrations?
That said, I did analyze the frequency spectrum using Audacity and the most prominent peak is at 84⅛ Hz, which is a smidge higher than E2 on a piano. As it happens, 5400 Hz is a smidge higher than E6 (you’ll need an extended 108-key keyboard for that one).  Being the same note, six octaves apart, I have to admit that if any song is going to cause problems due to resonant frequencies, Rhythm Nation would be it.
This should be easy to test with a signal generator. If one has sox installed, you could simply run
play -n synth sin E2
 and see what hard drives start logging ATA retries. Or, to be more accurate, one could use
play -n synth sin 84.375
 which is 5400÷2⁶, while E2 is 82.40689 Hz.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but if I recall my physics lessons correctly, resonance has little to do with the speed of rotation of an object**, and more about the natural frequency of vibration for that object, which is linked to (1) its length, and (2) the speed of a wave traveling through that object (the latter affected by object composition, e.g. aluminum, steel, etc.; its stiffness/thickness, i.e. the stiffer it is the faster it'll travel; and its mass, i.e. the heavier the slower the traveling wave will be).

Actually, the length would be a pretty major factor since it would dictate which frequency an object is “vulnerable” to by resonance; alter its length and the “attack” frequency no longer has any effect. Make any sense?
So, for a laptop HDD, for the length we would start with 2.5″ (so says http://209.68.14.80/ref/hdd/op/mediaSize-c.html) *minus* the diameter of the platter’s machined inner hole, with that measure then divided by 2 (i.e. the platter being a 2D annulus, the width of one of the two “bands” when you cut the annulus in half through its center).
But I wouldn’t have a clue as to the natural frequency of a single 2.5″ HDD platter; either it needs to be determined experimentally, or else there may be tables for common materials (with given density) by their thickness (or engineering software stacks/packages capable of computing them).
So, it’s probably more complicated than 5400RPM = 90 Hz.
[**wouldn’t angular momentum make platters *less* susceptible to vibration perpendicular to their surface, i.e. along the normal?]

I think it's more complicated than that, even. Resonant modes of a flat disc with a hole in it would be determined by a set of partial differential equations that I don't even want to think about, but the solution would also depend on how the disc is supported - that is, if you took the platter out of the drive and hung it on a string, it would have different resonance than it does when the entire inner circumference is held fixed inside the drive.
It doesn't have to be the platter, though - most of the drives I've torn...Read moreI think it’s more complicated than that, even.

It doesn’t have to be the platter, though – most of the drives I’ve torn apart had the heads on the end of long (relatively speaking) flat strips of spring steel, supported only at the end away from the head, so any resonance in them would have had its maximum amplitude at the head end, right where you really don’t want it.

@microsoftonline-com : 5400 rpm is 90 Hz. How is 5400 Hz relevant? 🙂

Many consumer laptops even as recently as 2013 didn’t bother with any sort of dampening because that would increase cost. Netbooks (what anecdotes from other commenters seem to indicate was the likely place this occurred) would definitely not have had any due to both size and cost reasons. 10¢ of rubber dampening matters a lot when competing in the sub $300 category sadly. When you build to a price you get what you pay for honestly.

Thanks for asking this question, this sounds like one of those stories that are too good to be true. If confirmed, it would make an excellent example while teaching the physics of resonances. So any sort of further detail would be very much appreciated.

The story seems to centre around the video, which contains around 20 seconds of just above sub-bass at around 50Hz to 100Hz with a couple of strong 82.4Hz amongst it. Surprised it didn’t happen more (if the drives were built to not dampen this)!

My colleague claims to have been part of the team that investigated the problem. I accept his word for it. (I also think the CVE is somebody playing a joke.)

Old laptop hard drives will allegedly crash when exposed to Janet Jackson music
At least this time Raymond is described as a Software Engineer and not Microsoft Executive.
