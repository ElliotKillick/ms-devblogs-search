Which is why you can use a markup extension and place it in a separate namespace.

Which is why you can use a markup extension and place it in a separate namespace.
However, likelihood of having to escape an identifier is low for most common data sets which tend to be CLS identifiers (C-like identifiers) or SQL column names, and tend to be designed for dot notation from C#, VB, C++, JavaScript, etc.  Because you‚Äôre commonly binding to some data structure which you assume to be written in some programming language, and since C-like identifiers tend to be valid in most current interesting candidates ‚Äì you really only hit this with ‚Äúalmost JSON.‚Äù
Generally, you‚Äôd have a view model you were binding to ‚Äì and so that would generally be C-like identifiers anyway.
I mean, you could hit it binding to an Excel file or another ODBC source, but that‚Äôd also be rare to want to bind to from a UI.  If you‚Äôre binding, you can usually alias column names ‚Äì for example ‚Äì and then you can provide header text, so there wouldn‚Äôt be any advantage to adding spaces, etc. in the majority case.
So I‚Äôm just saying ‚Äì the need of an apostrophe or double quote in a binding expression is relatively low.
Still, you can do it in a different namespace and then the compiler knows it if should use old behavior or new behavior.  Also, in WPF you can easily use an extension point and tie it to the new namespace name, and shoehorn in the feature without touching any of the compiler code.  Can‚Äôt do it with UWP, because the features are missing and ‚Äì instead ‚Äì there is a‚Ä¶ unique‚Ä¶ hard coded implementation.

The only definitive solution is to unceremoniusly kill XAML with fire. While we are there, please also kill XML as well. Or at least do not expose humans to it.

I‚Äôd much rather be presented with unknown XML data than unknown JSON data.
