Couldn‚Äôt be a sort of bug in the drivers or windows itself that may cause that error? ü§î

On the other hand if it happens only once it could be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. Desktop hard disks are usually rated for an URE rate of one read error every 10e14 bits and Desktop SSDs aren‚Äôt really designed for anything better. Of couse having a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù failure in the relatively small area that is used for the page cache is either really bad luck or indicates that the whole drive is failing. So you a probably right in the majority of cases.

There is another possible cause for this. Different but related. On laptop mechanical hard drives there is a shock detection device. It is possible to have that kick in cause this same BSOD. In this case if it clogs up user space everything stops but may not get terminated. Very interesting to debug.

Definitely had this happen to me. Disabling that hdd tilt (was supposed to be drop, but any lap use resulted in constant pausing) detection was the best thing I did for perf on a couple of older laptops.
