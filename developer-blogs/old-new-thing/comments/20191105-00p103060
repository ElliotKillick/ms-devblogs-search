Reminded me of a story told by Frank Cottrell Boyce:
Remember that time in 1973 when Uncle Billy went to watch the Reds beat Borussia Mönchengladbach 3–2 (on aggregate) in the final of the Uefa Cup? After the match, the Prussian police herded thousands of ecstatic scousers on to the waiting charter planes.

At the end of a long evening in some sort of party, he called himself an Uber to get home ... forgetting that "home" in this case was several hundred miles away, and he was staying in a nearby hotel for the duration of the conference.

Do you know how Steve was charged for the rental car? Was he forking out a minuscule few hundred dollars per day on a fancy car that just sat in the parking lot forgotten?
