Used to be (count anymore?) MS produced fine documentation of its APIs, complete with a source example for each call.  Then, the Consent Decree happened, around the year 2000 was it?  Since then API documentation is far, far, far away from fine.  Obviously, having the source of those APIs is itself fine (as in good enough â€” sloooooows one done, though), but who has the source to all APIs outside of those in Linux?  No one on this side of the curtain.  Thank you for reading this and doing something about it.
