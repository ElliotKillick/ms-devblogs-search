There’s a hidden bonus if you can read Korean, the way the character is pronounced is very similar to “check” in English!

This reminds me of an ancient joke: A newbie of C programming language yanked the power plug after he sees “烫烫烫” (lit. hot hot hot) printed on screen, in fear of the computer being overheated. “烫”, in code page 936, is 0xCCCC — that’s uninitialized stack.

I’m a bit troubled by the suggestion that the customer was shipping debug build of their software.

Not necessarily. They might have found this error during QA, for example.
OK, yes, probably they were shipping the debug build. I’m sure I’ve seen articles — whether here or on The Daily WTF I don’t know — about companies who shipped the debug build, because the release build kept crashing but the debug build worked fine (for certain values of “worked” and “fine”).
Why take the time and trouble to fix your errors, when you can just get the system to probably mask them for you?

The customer found this problem during development, even before handing over to QA. Developers use debug builds, so the problem was consistent there.

There’s money in uninitialized data? Who knew?

there is money if it leads to an exploit which allows you to plant malware on the victim’s computer

Round here, my font doesn’t support that character, so it’s a tiny box with
CD

in it, even easier to decode (if one thinks of looking).
