Doesn’t the long name case on x86-64 disclose something about the memory layout? Not a security issue on its own, but I could see that being a link in a chain for something that would be a problem.

Yeah. If the output of this is visible to an attacker, I think it would constitute a heap address leak, which as you said, wouldn’t be a vulnerability per se but could be convenient for the attacker to make use of once they get some kind of read or write primitive. It’s like finding a landmark to help you anchor your map to buried treasure or something, but you still need a way to get to the location of the treasure and dig it out.
