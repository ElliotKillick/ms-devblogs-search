It seems to me that UTF-8 with a BOM confuses rc.exe?
foo.rc(8) : error RC2135 : file not found: 0foo.rc(9) : error RC2135 : file not found: 0x17Lfoo.rc(11) : error RC2135 : file not found: FILEOS
UTF-16 with BOM works, though.

I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs still an issue, but years ago we would unpredictably get corrupted strings when compiling our translated .rc files even though the files were saved as UTF-8 and even though we specified `pragma code_page(65001)`.  We wanted to keep using UTF-8 because it played much more nicely with our source control system and code review tools, so we ended up converting them to UTF-16 at build time. =/

I checked my resource files and they are all UTF16 and it‚Äôs working.They are genereated by a PowerShell script, so I think it was an accident and nobody noticed it.

A more stable fix is to remove the dependency on the charset of the .rc file entirely by using Unicode escape sequence for characters outside of the intersection of the various code pages.

As an English speaker, you will probably tolerate an occasional \xC0D3 in strings.
In pretty much every other Latin-based language, escaping letters with diacritics gets annoying really fast.
In languages that use other scripts, such as Greek, Cyrillic, or CJK, escaping makes text unreadable.
So no. The right way is to use UTF-8 everywhere, enforce it, and enforce the enforcement. That is, make a linter rule that detects any .rc files that do not declare themselves as UTF-8.

I like your idea of enforcing UTF8-ness a lot better than my idea of being codepage-independent üôÇ

Ah a classical problem.
Not that there‚Äôs much we can do to improve that. I remember a problem where a .gitignore file got saved as utf-16 which caused it to ‚Äúignore‚Äù its contents (well it would‚Äôve ignore files with lots of embedded \0 characters).
Someone please invent a time machine.
