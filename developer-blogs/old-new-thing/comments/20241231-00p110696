Useful article.
I had written a streaming text I/O system a while back that was doing pretty well. Someday I might dig it up, and by correcting the places where I “left my hands”, let’s continue the discussion.
At the moment it’s holidays with us, I’m missing too many things to actively participate in the discussion.
Happy New Year, to those for whom it begins today!

Other than the drudgery of doing it, are there and fundamental blocks to just intentionally forcing everything to UTF-8?
I can see why other encodings were a thing at one point, but none of the reasons I’m aware of still carry much weight.

Not all tools default to UTF-8, so you'd have to remember to put the appropriate directive at the start of every file. And some tools default to producing UTF-16LE files, so you'll have to remember to manually convert them every time you create a new project. Choosing a default different from your toolchain's default creates friction, the Microspeak jargon for which is impedance mismatch.

Yes, for the Resource Compiler the “#pragma code_page(65001)” works fine (thanks for that).
However sometimes you want to pass localized strings via a -D switch to cl.exe, e.g.
cl -c … -DCUSTOMERNAME=”Åreskutans fjällby” …
for least amount of pain I use:
cl -c … -DCUSTOMERNAME=”\xC5reskutans fj\xE4llby” …
