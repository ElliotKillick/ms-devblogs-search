Does any of this rely on things that are not contractual guarantees?  IT sounds like of shaky.

GetThreadStackLimits and SetThreadStackGuarantee are APIs with contractual behavior. The stack growth direction is part of the ABI. Where local variables are stored is something between you and your compiler.

The blog software must be hiccuping, because the post disappeared for a while. And the short summaries haven’t been summaries in all of the recent posts.

There was a problem on the site yesterday and they had to restore from a backup, which is why some recent posts temporarily vanished until I could repost them. Looks like the restore didn’t preserve the short summaries. I’ll touch them up.

Because I’ve seen it so often here, I can’t help but expect this series to end with “… but don’t bother trying to do any of that, because the value may have changed anyway by the time you want to use it. Just try to allocate the memory and handle the consequences if it fails.”
I suspect that this is an example of circumstances altering cases, though.
