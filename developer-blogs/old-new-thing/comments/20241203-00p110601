A few years ago I was consulted at work when a long running DAQ task (data acquisition, essentially sampling a voltage at high frequency) resulted in suspicious (like repeated) samples right around the 10 minutes mark. Turns out this was the time the “cloud based thread detection” determined that the executable was harmless after all and tried to unhook from it. No crash or anything, just a few garbled measurements. Solution was to sign the executable with a signature the antivirus trusted in the first place, but that was somewhat tricky to find out.

I’ve used this trick myself, and quite recently too, in supporting enterprise software.  In my most recent case, an anti-malware package – hmm, let’s call it “GroupAssault” – hooked the LoadLibraryW function to run some of it’s own code whenever a program loaded a DLL.  Some of my software wouldn’t install because this detour crashed the program while loading the installer’s DLLs.  I saw the anti-malware’s DLLs in the stack traces of the crash, including some  frames.  I asked them to uninstall “GroupAssault” and retry; like magic the install worked.
