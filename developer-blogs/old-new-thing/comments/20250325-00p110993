Almost all of the USB to PS/2 mouse adapters are purely rewiring as you say Raymond, but one isn't : HIDMan. That will accept USB keyboards and mice (up to five buttons) and output PS/2 (or serial mouse). It can be fairly easily made at popular PCB fabrication places as it's open source. I've recently had a few made and they're excellent, enabling me to use a modern remappable USB keyboard, and will help if I want move on from my Logitech MX518, probably the last multi button mouse to support both PS/2 and USB directly.

I’ve recently had a few made and they’re excellent, enabling me to use a modern remappable USB keyboard, and will help if I want move on from my Logitech MX518, probably the last multi button mouse to support both PS/2 and USB directly.
To go the other way, there are many PS/2 to USB adapters on the market, but they’re of varying quality, don’t tend to stay in manufacturer catalogues, and typically contain one of only a few basic chips/USB IDs, but you can’t see what chip is in them so the best advice is normally ‘buy Startech’. The reliable way is likely to be to buy a TMK keyboard protocol converter (also supports mice), again the firmware and hardware are open source.
One good reason to buy a TMK (I’m going to, just haven’t yet) is for mice with more than three buttons. Whilst USB does support multi buttons natively, all the PS/2 to USB converters I’ve tried so far don’t, I had to use real PS/2 to see five buttons enabled. TMK claims they support five button mice so I’ll be buying one to handle the slightly ridiculous signal path of USB keyboard/mouse->HIDMan->PS/2 KVM (*good* USB KVMs are expensive, particularly the cables)->TMK converter->USB (yes, the PS/2 KVM does also plug directly into PS/2 only systems, one system using a serial mouse and AT keyboard, and a Sparcstation using a cheap F1DE083UK PS/2->Sun converter).
If you don’t want to do TMK, note my experiences with seeing what adapters a MiSTer FPGA system supported PS/2->USB mice was (may have changed now):
Works :
0557:2221  (unmarked adapter). Identifies as : Aten Winbond Hermon
0557:2221 Branded Aten UC-10KVM. Same chipset as unmarked adapter!
04b4:2324 (unmarked adapter) Cypress Semiconductor USB PS/2 bridge
Non working :
0d3d:0001 Tangtop Ltd HID keyboard adapter (the square one. Not a surprise, it is only designed to support keyboards)
13ba:0018 PCPlay Barcode PCP-BCG4209
13ba:0018 another unmarked adapter.
Do you feel lucky?

Pretend that this is an image of an usb flash drive attached to such an adapter, which is plugged into a PS/2 to serial adapter, plugged into a small to wide serial port adapter, plugged into a dialup modem.

You can buy both these days. I still use the Microsoft Natural Elite Keyboards and often an eBay find of one doesn’t come with the adapter for USB. Thankfully the passive PS/2 adapters for mice also work for the keyboards. The active adapters work, but tend to be a little glitchy at times.

The passive adapters working with mice and keyboards is no surprise, since the PS/2 pinouts are the same.
I guess there’s a chance that some devices would use a reverse USB D+,D- -> PS/2 CLK, DATA mapping, but it seems unlikely because it’s simpler and cheaper to standardise on one adapter pinout.

There are definitely smart adaptors available, I use them all the time since I use a IBM Model M keyboard on a daily basis with various PCs that don’t have PS/2 ports.

Raymond is talking about the other way : USB to PS/2. The only active converter I'm aware of that's reliable is HIDMan.
I was using Unicomp's Endura Pro and Classic keyboards, pretty similar to a Model M, but when they died I had the old school choice : lead time,  expense, and overseas shipping of a niche PS/2 keyboard with a Dvorak layout programmed. Alternatively, the modern way : buy a programmable keyboard off the shelf and order a HIDMan.
The HIDMan is great, the Montech TKL keyboard I bought a bit less so! Key action is OK but could...Read moreRaymond is talking about the other way : USB to PS/2. The only active converter I’m aware of that’s reliable is HIDMan.

The HIDMan is great, the Montech TKL keyboard I bought a bit less so! Key action is OK but could be better, the reprogramming software is a bit limited, and if you keep plugging and unplugging it occasionally it forgets what a key does(!). It was great being able to drive to a computer shop and have the keyboard less than an hour later, but I’m on the hunt for a better one now, and there’s plenty of choice.

It probably depends to some extent on the manufacturer, but I have a couple of PS/2-to-USB adapters with transparent blue cases (thus providing a pretty good estimate of when I acquired them) that definitely contain smarts.
Not enough smarts, though – they don’t properly implement the USB boot keyboard specification, so you still need a proper USB keyboard to do anything with the BIOS.
