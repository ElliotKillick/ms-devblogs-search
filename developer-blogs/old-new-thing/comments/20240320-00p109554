Pretty clear example of Microsoft ignoring the win32 api here – nobody would design this from first principles as the right way to do this for win32 apps.  If microsoft won’t provide a new  GetWindowExStyle (or maybe  GetWindowExExStyle) then I guess a third party will have to.
ps  I realize GetWindowExStyle is the wrong place for this return value, I just wanted to be able to invent a function with ExEx in the name.  Something closer to GetSystemMetrics would be the right place, but obviously fails because you need to know the result on a per monitor basis.

Those functions in Win32 API already exist. MonitorFromWindow, EnumDisplaySettings, etc.
