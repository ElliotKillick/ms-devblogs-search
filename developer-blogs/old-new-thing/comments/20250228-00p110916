I definitely prefer the mixin style (whether CRTP or deducing this) since it adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle. Alternatively I might provide both the “core” mixin class, which doesn’t pull in winrt::implements, as well as the “framework” class that does it; there’s no code duplication since the “framework” class can just inherit from the “core” class. But if I had to choose one, I’d provide the mixin, which is the only composable architecture between the two.
