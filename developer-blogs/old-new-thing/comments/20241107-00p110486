Interesting! Small question about the usage of WriteFile in this context, the manual page about CreateFileMapping states that “A mapped file and a file that is accessed by using the input and output (I/O) functions (ReadFile and WriteFile) are not necessarily coherent.” but in the article you state that “Windows NT unifies memory-mapped files with the file cache, these writes will be coherent with the memory mapping” which is in contradiction, is the current information in the docs outdated/untrue? if so what is the explanation behind this?

But it is probably OK to stop mapping the file, fill the necessary blocks with zeros with WriteFile(), and map the file again. The question is, how much overhead such sequence adds, and how this compares to the time spent on useless reads?

“not necessarily” probably means that there may be cases where you can get it to work for now but they might not work later so you shouldn’t try.

I’ll assume the documentation is correct. Thanks for calling it out.

Thanks Raymond. BTW, my dad, Moshe Lichtman, Windows 95 Plug&Play, says hi.

What would happen if you tried to use FSCTL_SET_ZERO_DATA to free those blocks of the file?
Edit: It won’t necessarily work, so you shouldn’t try it.
