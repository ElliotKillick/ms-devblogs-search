That doesn’t really help. You’d still need to cast it, because there is no standard conversion from T** to IUnknown**, not even if T derives from IUnknown. (Unless T = IUnknown, but that’s not an interesting case.)

Just use your time machine to change the second parameter of IUnknown::QueryInterface from void** to IUnknown**.
