Quoting from your article, but I don't know whether your feed software will mess this up:
      template<typename C,
               std::enable_if_t<!std::is_same_v<C, bool>, int> = 0>
      buffer_view(std::vector<C> const& v) :
        data(v.data()), size(v.size() * sizeof(C)) { }
Does this on its own not already prevent you from using buffer_view(std::vector const&) with a sufficiently usable diagnostic? When I try it I get (amongst other diagnostics) the following:
error: no matching constructor for initialization...Read moreQuoting from your article, but I don’t know whether your feed software will mess this up:

error: no matching constructor for initialization of ‘buffer_view’
note: candidate template ignored: requirement ‘!std::is_same<bool, bool>::value’ was not satisfied [with C = bool]
Seems fairly clear to me.
