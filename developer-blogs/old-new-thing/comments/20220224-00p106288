This looks like so much work to do in order to have resiliency in your client.
You’d think there would be a way to configure the proxy to always do asynchronous releases under the hood, some sort of
HRESULT CoSetProxyAsyncRelease(IUnknown* pProxy, BOOL fAsync)
 function.
Or even better, that it would be the default. Let’s face it, you are releasing your object, which means you don’t care about it anymore. You certainly don’t care at that point if the connection to the server failed or is hung.

Given this is probably from a callback…
HRESULT CoSetProxyAsyncReleaseWhenCallbackReturns(IUnknown* pProxy, BOOL fAsync)
