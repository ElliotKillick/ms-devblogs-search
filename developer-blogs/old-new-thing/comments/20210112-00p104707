When SHCNE_UPDATEDIR arrives pointing to the 2-byte Desktop PIDL, does that mean the whole tree should be refreshed? I’ve seen it used ambiguously many times.
Also there’s been this weird quirk where calling SHQueryRecycleBin() seems to fire SHCNE_UPDATEDIR for the Recycle Bin. This can throw apps that monitor the Recycle Bin into an infinite loop.

Still remember when inotify on Linux silently drops excessive file change events if happens too frequently, causing trouble on use of FileSystemWatcher in Mono project.
Now at least you get a grouped event.
