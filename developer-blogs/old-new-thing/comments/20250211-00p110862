Talking of Win95 Setup, have they considered about when starting from DOS, use stripped Win95 environment and Win16 GUI setup app for 1st-stage GUI part?

the first stage of Win95 setup runs on top of a stripped-down Windows 3.1

Windows 95 didnâ€™t include EGA support, but you could actually install and use it on EGA, which I did via a hacky upgrade from a Windows 3.x. Of course everything was somewhat stretched vertically, but it worked alright.
