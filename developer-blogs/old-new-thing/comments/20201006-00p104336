My XtremeMac A to C cable is bidirectional on the A side, too.

I suspect the convenience of Type C‚Äôs reversibility comes at the cost of lifespan.  The contacts are much smaller than the ones on a Type A connector (for a variety of reasons, including reversibility).  As cables are disconnected and reconnected, the contacts will wear, and, presumably, smaller contacts will wear out faster.  And the higher current ratings of Type C means the smaller contacts are already closer to the minimum size required.  In fact, to get the rated 5A, the current is split across four pairs of conductors.

I‚Äôve had a few permanently connected USB-C cables stop working for no visible reason (the cable simply wouldn‚Äôt be held in the socket any more). These were USB-C to DisplayPort used on NUCs.

If it‚Äôs a connector you are plugging and unplugging a lot, you‚Äôll probably lose the cable (or other device) before the contacts wear out‚Ä¶.

I‚Äôm not sure the logos are all that consistent. I orient USB A plugs using the join in the metal shielding, which seems to always be on the underside.

You try to plug it in, it doesn`t work, you turn it, retry, it doesn`t work either so you turn it again and in it goes. Works every time.

I eventually discovered the 2 "holes" on the top idea to detect the orientation of A cables. This works for me for most cables and sticks with no logo or black on black logos (I find the silver metal easy to see even in low ambient light). The top has the "holes" punched "through" the metal and the other side has them "filled in".
All my devices (luckily?) have the orientation correct and vertical recepticles have the top on the "left". And I'm not very adventurous when it comes to choosing usb memory stick brands so I don't have to...Read moreI eventually discovered the 2 ‚Äúholes‚Äù on the top idea to detect the orientation of A cables.

I can feel for the two ‚Äúprongs‚Äù on one side of Micro-USB connectors which I use to orient the cable for plugging into my headset.
Would still prefer USB-C of course.

I checked a random collection of 10 cables in arms reach. 2 of 10 has a usb logo. 2 of 10 has no logo. 6 of 10 has vendor logo where the first 2 had usb logo. So ‚ÄúThe manufacturer logo, if present, faces down‚Äù was a 100% miss for me.
Edit: no cables had both usb logo and vendor logo.

In order to manufacture USB components, you‚Äôre supposed to be part of the USB Implementors. If you pay the dues, and follow the technical requirements, you get to put a usb logo on the ‚Äútop‚Äù of your cable.
I feel the cables you bought may have been manufactured by someone who didn‚Äôt belong to the USB association. üôÇ

Among other things:
To qualify for the right to display these logos, products must pass the specified USB-IF compliance testing for product quality.

I read that one of the inventors of the USB specification (or the form factor, or something) recently passed away.  He was buried upside down at first, so he had to be taken out and turned over.
(I hope that‚Äôs not disrespectful!)
And yay to the designers of USB-C so that it works in both orientations.
I looked at sixdifferent brands of USB flash drives in my desk.  None of them has a USB logo on the plug.

Presumably, though, the flash drives have a clear ‚Äútop‚Äù. Most likely proudly declaring their company name.

They should have used a sticker.

Works great until you‚Äôve got a vertical USB port and it‚Äôs unclear whether left or right is ‚Äúup‚Äù. üòÄ
(And a special raspberry to micro USB ports on devices that are mounted ‚Äúupside down‚Äù; so the micro USB logo needs to be pointing down when the device is screen up; I‚Äôm looking at you unnamed popular ebook reader)

Hence why:
There are some manufacturers who install their USB receptacles sideways or (heaven forfend) upside-down. I use a small sticker to identify the ‚Äúlogical top‚Äù side of those receptacles.
