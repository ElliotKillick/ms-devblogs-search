It's easy to break the assumptions of Unix programmers. There are programs that change their behavior depending on the value of , usually because you're supposed to make one or more symlinks with different names. I have to wonder what those programs do if you pass an empty argument list (POSIX says the application "should" ensure that the binary name is given as , but in their base definitions, "should" indicates a portability recommendation rather than a strict requirement, so this is at least somewhat POSIX-legal).
