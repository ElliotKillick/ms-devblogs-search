In the TV world, a “walk-on” is someone who has one or two lines and then is (usually) not seen again!
Then again it could be a preface to telling an agenda item to “jog on”…!

One regular work meeting that I attend allocates time at the end (where possible) for “walk up” items.  The focus here on the exact preposition used – “up”, “in”, or “on” – seems misguided.  The more important detail is whether the meeting allows for ad-hoc topics for discussion.

The “walk-off home run” is another sports metaphor — a home-run that ends the game.
I think I’ve been to some meetings with a “walk-off” discussion topic.

It seems to me that since you put items on an agenda, that is the most likely reason for the choice of adverbial preposition "on" rather than it being aligned with the sports metaphor. To get on the agenda, it walks onto the agenda. In sports, you walk on to the field. And as you point out the others also follow a similar pattern, walking up to a service window and walking into an establishment. Walk-on can also be used of theater, presumably where someone walks on to the stage though that also has the connotation of being a minor...Read moreIt seems to me that since you put items on an agenda, that is the most likely reason for the choice of adverbial preposition “on” rather than it being aligned with the sports metaphor.

Walk-on can also be used of theater, presumably where someone walks on to the stage though that also has the connotation of being a minor part again presumably because there is no need for an invitation to such a minor role. All this to say that when a topic makes it into your blog uninvited, I believe it would be most natural to refer to it as a walk-in but not because your blog is anything more like an establishment than a window service or sports team.

You don’t “walk onto” an agenda. But you do “walk into” a meeting.
