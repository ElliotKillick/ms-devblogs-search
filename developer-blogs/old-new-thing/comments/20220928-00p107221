My question regarding a different aspect of COM as shown in the project BmpExt in this old article here:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2000/march/windows-2000-ui-innovations-enhance-your-user-s-experience-with-new-infotip-and-icon-overlay-shell-extensions
The shell extension is informed of the full-path filename of the file where the mouse hovers upon, but only for disk-based file systems and not for files that exist in portable devices such as a camera or a smartphone.
What must I do to have a comprehensible shell extension that also informs the extension of those files in portable device systems ?

The members of the clock value are represented in big endian in the struct with first clock_seq_hi, then cloc[k?]_seq_low. So these two bytes come out big endian style.
The first field in the printf format should probably be “%08x”?
