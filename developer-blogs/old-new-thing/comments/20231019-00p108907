There is also the option to do a soft discard of the page. It may be reused at the discretion of the memory manager. But if you don’t dawdle too long and are lucky, you can undiscard it, with all the contents still intact. Be a slowpoke or get unlucky and you’ll just have to deal with losing the data. Naturally, this option is best used for caches and other data that can be recomputed/reloaded.

Two options: MEM_RESET/MEM_RESET_UNDO (since Windows 8) and OfferVirtualMemory/ReclaimVirtualMemory (since Windows 8.1 Update).

This is like “I have this cupboard full of rubbish, so I will solve that by nailing the doors shut”. No that’s not the solution. What you have to do is emptying the cupboard so you can put other (perhaps more useful) things on it, or maybe throwing out the whole cupboard with its contents.
