Physical disk sectors are supposed to be intellectual property, but I guess they must map to expected sectors to avoid defying physics. At any rate, I’d rather Windows put my data on the most reliable sectors instead of the fastest. Also all things being equal, there was a song about spinning records or some such that I can’t remember anymore.

Well, most people do not consider operating system files to be their most valuable data, so I guess Microsoft has a point on that.

Once upon a time, when SSD still had low write cycles was considered not-to-be-trusted because of wearout problem, the “best practice” of installing SQL server is to put the OS on SSD and put the data on standalone SAS array.
Btw, most SAS/SCSI/Raid controller also have pre-fetch logic on the firmware to improve read performance. I wonder if Windows will detect and adjust the prefetch size on those systems.

Hmm… Never had noticed the ReadyBoot and ReadyBoost similarity. I usually don’t remember Microsoft brand names when I don’t buy or actively use them.
ReadyBoot is the logical prefetcher.  ReadyBoost, however, is the better-known part of Superfetch.

I look at all this cleverness and optimisation and beautifully layered driver model, and I feel sad because it’s all wasted. On top of all this excellence, Microsoft is encouraging people to run Teams, a product so bad, I don’t actually think it matters what OS it runs on.

I will never understand why people think they must vent their grievances about completely off topic products that Raymond doesn’t even work on on this blog. It’s also usually accompanied with amazing amounts of hyperbole.
To stay on topic I always wondered what values the source column could have. It’s nice that Raymond explains them here, but some better official documentation would be very much welcome in that area.

I kinda like this “word merchant” actually.  At least for me, I like hearing some funny words every now and then.  (Also I don’t think this is the only instance in which people have jeered at Microsoft Teams in the comment sections of this blog.)
