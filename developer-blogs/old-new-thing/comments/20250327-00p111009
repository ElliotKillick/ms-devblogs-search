A combo box selection shouldn’t trigger a dialog box if you can help it, but it can legitimately cause an adjacent pane of controls to appear that were otherwise hidden. This kind of thing is completely easy in XAML where you can directly bind the visibility of the pane to the combo box value.

The “Custom…” option is (or was) often used in colour selector combo boxes; clicking it typically invokes (invoked) the Windows colour picker (modal) dialog.

Your proposed solution doesn’t seem ideal either.
seems ok accessibility-wise  if selecting a list item shows a modeless dialog box displayed off to the side, non-overlapping, and non-focus stealing (or you could just add extra controls to the dialog, but that’s more programmer’s work).

2000/XP did this with the Browse item in find files. The keyboard navigation becomes slightly annoying but not a big deal.

Oh, how I hate all the dialog boxes that start to do anything before I click “apply”, “next”, “ok” or whatever button means I’m done with selection. But the examples of such behavior are just here, in Windows itself. In Win10 Display Settings dialog starts switching active displays, their orientation and resolution right after changing the value of comboboxes. And this is much more destructive than showing an extra dialog box. Accessibility? Didn’t hear

I would tend to disagree for this specific scenario. This is an efficiency thing. When you make changes to display settings the only way to know whether you'll like it (or if it works) is to see it. That is what the UI is doing. It is temporarily applying the changes so you can determine if this is what you want. If the UX required the user to click OK, Apply or whatever then the changes are now permanent, even if you didn't want them. There would be no way to easily get back to the previous values without adding...Read moreI would tend to disagree for this specific scenario. This is an efficiency thing.

If the UX required the user to click OK, Apply or whatever then the changes are now permanent, even if you didn’t want them. There would be no way to easily get back to the previous values without adding an undo button.
But what makes this even worse is if the display changes make it such that you cannot even see the display anymore. You can’t click a revert/undo button if the screen is black, too large to fit on the monitor, etc. That is why, historically, when you apply changes to the display it puts a “did this work” display up. If you don’t confirm it is good before it times out it automatically reverts.
Note that many UX, such as printers, WYSIWYG editors, follow this same behavior. As you make changes to your settings then it shows you what it’ll look like. If you don’t like it then you can immediately switch back from the setting you just changed. It saves you from the process of: make change, click test button, dismiss test, make another change, repeat.
But none of this should mess up accessibility or keyboard navigation. That is the actual issue with this blog post. Popping up a new UX just because a user tabbed to a control is not good.

So I need to see all the resolutions between the current one and the needed one in sequence if I change it with the keyboard? Remember that changing the display resolution takes time, causes the screen to go blank for a moment and some of the modes can be not working properly. This is exactly the scenario when I want to set everything up, double check and only then apply the settings. And bonus point: after changing the settings in this dialog you always get a confirmation dialog er... something that asks if the settings are good or should be...Read moreSo I need to see all the resolutions between the current one and the needed one in sequence if I change it with the keyboard?

Yeah, but these are “modern” UIs, not dialog boxes, where clicking anything should just immediately change this, no need to do ok/cancel/whatever.
It’s just that to many of those (me included) used to the ok/cancel idiom, and the rollback opportunity it provides, these new UIs are horrible half of the time.
