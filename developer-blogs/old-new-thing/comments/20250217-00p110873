If you are doing C++ then you should specify the type of enum base, if you are doing this trick.
If you are doing C then it’s best to add MaximumValue =2147483647 to ensure that different compilers and platforms wouldn’t change the layout of your class after you would add 256th flavor.
Because otherwise, according to the C/C++ standard, adding Mint to Vanilla, Chocolate, and Strawberry is legal, but adding Watermelon to that is no longer legal!

Rust has `#[non_exhaustive]` for this. https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/attributes/type_system.html#the-non_exhaustive-attribute

I like the idea of an [Open] attribute to apply to enums.. similar to [Flags].   Documentation isn’t enough – there are so many de/serialization and ORM etc frameworks, that will throw exceptions when they see “flavor: 7”.
And this would help settle, once and for all, the ageless debate over whether or not it’s a breaking-change to add a value to an enum.

In the Apache Avro schema language, an enum type can have a default value, to which any unrecognized values are mapped during deserialization.  This feature improves compatibility if a message is written using a newer version of the schema but is then read by software that uses an older version.  Unlike C# and C++, Avro does not support casting arbitrary integers to an enum type.

I'm sorry for this unrelated comment, but I'd like to suggest an article topic, and I don't see a suggestion box anyplace. 😅
Last year you shared with us the origins of the "Windows 3D Pipes" screensaver, which in part was a demonstration of OpenGL. I've been researching three interrelated screensavers from Plus! for XP that I believe were made to demonstrate Direct3D 8 shaders: "Mercury Pool", "Robot Circus" and "Sand Pendulum". Their team or project may have been called "MeSmer"; if there's any record of their work, or who it was that made the screensavers in the first place, I'd...Read moreI’m sorry for this unrelated comment, but I’d like to suggest an article topic, and I don’t see a suggestion box anyplace. 😅

In C# I always make the first value (0) in an enum “Unknown” which should always be seen as an invalid value, and contextually different from “Other”. Then default(T) will always naturally set to this value in case someone forgets to assign to it. I’m willing to bet WidgetFlavor will probably be set to Vanilla much more often than it ought to…

Unknown is not the same as Invalid. Unknown means “I don’t know what it is.” Invalid means “I know what it is, but it’s not an allowed value.” For example, if somebody fills out a form and they leave the “country” field blank, then it’s Unknown. If they write “Saturn”, then it’s Invalid.
