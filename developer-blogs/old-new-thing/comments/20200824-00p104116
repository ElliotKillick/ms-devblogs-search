Can understand why taskmgr these days only shows a single CPU graph, instead of 1 graph per CPU. I remember Windows servers with 16 or 32 cores trying to display each core in taskmgr, was fun to look at I guess!

You need to right-click the graph and choose Change graph to \ Logical processors.

> The hard way is to call GetLogicalProcessorInformationEx and ask for RelationGroup.
Note it has to be GetLogicalProcessorInformationEx, not GetLogicalProcessorInformation, which is slightly easier to parse. The latter has the same limitation and only reports the processors in the current processor group. On Raymond‚Äôs example machine with 80 logical processors, GetLogicalProcessorInformation would report a single ‚ÄúRelationGroup‚Äù with 40 logical processors in them (usually 20 cores with 2 threads each).

By the way, happy Windows 95 anniversary, Mr. Chen. üòä
I miss the engineers behind it.

How lucky to run into this post. I was trying to find a way to get the number of available CPU cores in Node.js. Lately, I‚Äôve been having some extra time, so I thought why not get a copy of e-Mage‚Äôs source code and alter it so that it processes its image list one per CPU core at a time.

You can get 96 vCPUs using an Azure VM‚Ä¶although I suspect it would blow my monthly MSDN Azure budget instantly.

‚Äú64 processors ought to be enough for anybody.‚Äù

In times, where only the most expensive machines had 4 cores, it seemed like a good idea to use bitmask for logical processor (HW thread) affinities and everything.
