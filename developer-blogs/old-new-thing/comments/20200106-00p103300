Implementing such iterator requires either something like a stack in the iterator or pointers to siblings in nodes. Former approach is essentially hand made recursion, and latter one will end up with insane amount of bookkeeping in tree operations. So let me guess, you’re going to implement it through pointer arithmetic magic?

The requirements of the TreeCursor class are given in the article. There are many cursors that satisfy the requirements, such as DOM Node, XmlNode, GetWindow, and IUIAutomationTreeWalker.
