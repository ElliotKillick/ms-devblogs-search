So Close is just like the Close methods you find on sockets, connections, etc (which C++ and Rust call the destructor), but with the additional restriction that it’s illegal to call it while the async is in flight? In Rust you can just drop a Future before it completes, and it will automatically cancel the async operation, and that seems like a reasonable way you can support calling Close on an in-progress async in any language.

Automatic cancellation sounds like an invitation to Heisenbugs (races between cancellation upon destruction and completion). It also reminds me of non-detached non-joined std::thread calling std::terminate upon destruction, which makes it much easier to write sane code.
