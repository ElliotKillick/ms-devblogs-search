That's a dangerous thing to post, especially the "current process". We used to do something similar in that we'd have 1-2 interviews before lunch and then take the interviewee to lunch so they could meet with the CIO. During one particular interview it was clear they weren't the right candidate so after the 2nd interview my boss walked them out, without lunch. The problem was that the recruiter had already given them the plan for the day (including the lunch with 3rd interview) so needless to say the interviewee knew it was a no as they were being shown out.

We have since changed our process to only give a general timeframe and 1 interview with possibly another interview if certain people ‚Äúwere available‚Äù. We also rarely do lunch anymore and we commit to it even if it is clear the interviewee isn‚Äôt going to work out.

If a company decides to not pursue the process with a candidate any further, it is their obligation to tell the candidate _immediately_ that this is the case. So the company was failing miserably but the recruiter having communicated the schedule ahead of time saved the day, because the candidate knew that they were out even if the company didn‚Äôt have the whatevers to tell them.
So instead of blaming the company for being such spineless cowards, why are you blaming the recruiter? This makes absolutely no sense to me. May no candidate ever again consider working for that company.

Fundamentally disagree here. Never, in all my decades of both interviewing and being a candidate have I ever seen or heard of a case where the interviewers were responsible for telling the candidate that they weren't a good fit. The recruiter, an employee of the company in this case (but not always), is responsible for this. They collect the feedback from the teams and let the interviewee know that they aren't going to move forward and, in many cases, provide feedback as to why. It could be that the candidate didn't have sufficient knowledge, they interviewed poorly, they didn't fit...Read moreFundamentally disagree here.

I'm sorry, you misread that post and unfairly jumped on Ibert.
We don't think you're a good fit Mr Taylor and you won't be proceeding to the next round of comments ;)
The Company (not a specific interviewer), has a moral obligation to inform potential candidates of the outcome as early as possible.
In some jurisdictions, that's also a legal requirement once someone has been offered an interview.
Of course, this cuts both ways - once a candidate decides they don't wish to work for the potential employer, they also have a moral duty to let the company know as soon as...Read moreI‚Äôm sorry, you misread that post and unfairly jumped on Ibert.
