This is a late April fools joke, right? "terminal servers"? That is your reasoning? Where Windows 11 is mostly a desktop user OS in most cases? Where just one user is using the computer? And a terminal server is a rare exception? And you take that rare exception as the "normal use case"? To make the user experience horrible WORSE? And give NO OPTION, to let the USER decide what they want? Give back at least a simple working clock widget when you click on the clock, like Windows 10 had.

A clock like this with seconds is missing in Windows 11, add it again in the calendar as a widget which is not shown always, just when you click on the clock, which is btw ALSO NOW useless in Windows 11, because you CANT add events to it, for example to Google calendar.

Assuming that the impact in performance is that significant, I don’t think so because it does not seem to make a difference on win10, but let’s assume that is does, having the option or even that hidden registry for those that want it for some reason would be easy.
This look s more like it messes something else and this is the excuse we are going with. Affecting performance, but something that should not

I just wrote a comment, only for this website to trigger an error 500. Wow even wordpress is to difficult for the Microsoft developer…

So updating the taskbar takes to much resources, yet Windows spends time installing Candy Crush. Not to mention the ads within explorer, the ads in the news widget, the weather updates and so on.
O, and also spending cpu resources of collecting and sending my user data, all of that is afcourse way more important compared to actual functions that the customers want.
This blog sounds more like its poorly written code by the developers of Windows

I use the WinAero Tweaker app to enable seconds in the taskbar clock… so I don’t understand this blog? Showing seconds works?

Hang on… there is a way to show seconds in the clock, because I used the WinAero Tweaker app to enable it. So, what’s going on?

I have this enabled on my MacBook; I wonder what performance trade-off I’ve made.

I remember it was not CPU time but the bandwidth taken by the RDP traffic (this was important when dial-up modems were still common).
