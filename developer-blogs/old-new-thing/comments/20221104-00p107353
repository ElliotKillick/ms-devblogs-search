So the real problem is the exception thrown in this situation. If it had thrown, say, RPC_E_THREAD_UNINITIALIZED or RPC_E_THREAD_OUTOFSCOPE (exceptions I just made up), the programmer might have figured it out herself. On the other hand, I congratulated myself on guessing the problem correctly based solely on your postâ€™s title. ðŸ˜‰
