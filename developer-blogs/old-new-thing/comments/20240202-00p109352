This reminds me of https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20231110-00/?p=108991 similar story and technique, different manifestations.

I enjoy these debugging trips – but so many layers…
On a slightly connected note, I vaguely wonder how many implementations of a scrollbar are present in the average IT person’s installation of Windows, when you add multiple versions of .net, Office, browsers, Visual Studio, the unloved Teams, and, and… all the way down to the original implementations lurking, unused and unloved, somewhere in user.
How much faster and environmentally efficient everything would be with all the accretions removed.

The pde.dll debugger extension used in this post ("You can use the !pde.dse extension to dump the stowed exceptions.") is not included in the WinDbg package. At least, not the one you can get from learn.microsoft.com now (WinDbg 1.2308.2002.0).
Some luck with web searching suggests it's most likely "PDE v11.3 - Copyright 2017 Andrew Richards" which I found from the OneDrive link on the Defrag Show homepage on learn.microsoft.com. (I'm avoiding links because those have been blocked by the comment spam filter before.)
Raymond, I'd suggest you add an authoritative link to the right place in the original post.

I found a link to it (probably the same OneDrive folder) here:
