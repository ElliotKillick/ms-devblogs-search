Possible uses of the TEQ instruction:
Not setting the carry flag when you're not shifting an argument. Never setting the overflow flag.
Directly setting flags. When you use R15 as the LHS of a TEQ, the flags get masked out, so the top bits of the result are always that of the RHS. But when you use R15 as the result of a TEQ (i.e. TEQP), then (rather than the flags of the result) the result gets copied to the flags of R15. As a simple case, TEQP R15, Rn copies the flag bits from Rn to R15.

I see ARM has a bit-reversal instruction these days but without that I have a vague memory of some code that used TEQP to check whether two bits were different and following that up with an EORN to flip both bits at once.

Thumb-2 explicitly disallows pc and sp as destinations for the TEQ instruction. Even in classic ARM, using pc as the destination register is now deprecated. The flag bits haven’t been kept in pc since ARM 3, and the masking/copying behavior you describe no longer exists.

Ah, that explains it – I only got to use ARM 2.
