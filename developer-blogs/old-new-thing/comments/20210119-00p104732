The customer could of course mimic 3d mode by reducing the screen resolution as far as possible, smearing engine grease on both his glasses and the screen, then asking a friend to shake the monitor from side to side very quickly. An occasional head-but of the nearest wall would be sufficient to keep the 3d headache going.

I guess there’s limits to DirectX 10’s claim of “if the hardware doesn’t support it we’ll do it in CPU” so applications don’t have to feature check anymore.

How would you emulate this feature?

Of course there are. I wouldn't expect DirectX to give me a VR experience if I don't own a VR headset.
That probably only supports common features that make sense to emulate in CPU. As an example, anyone can dream up a new, esoteric feature for a new graphics card; DirectX obviously can't support CPU emulation for features that haven't been invented yet, so it's unreasonable to expect them to support any feature based on that alone.

Kinect was glorious, so who killed it? Why is Nintendo 3DS being shelved rather than remake every 3D classic? Did people really not like 3D Blurays? Yeah right. There are no 3D fads because tech companies don’t allow them to happen, usually by stonewalling new content. We keep getting forced and prodded into VR even though I read very bad things about the kind of mental programming that can be done using high frame rates like VR’s 90 fps.

Kinect was a glitchy nightmare. Hardware was good but software was absolute garbage 99% of the time.
Nintendo 3DS is extremely underpowered for doing much big 3D gaming. Trust me, I have 5 of the things. If anyone wants them to be good at everything it would be me. Plus the 3D gave most people headaches to the point of most people just leaving the switch all the way off
3D movies at home never really took off because 3D tv's never took off. At least 5 different ways were tried that I can think of off...Read moreIn order of comment

There is no “mental programming” in VR. The only thing that’s happening at 90 FPS is you losing your lunch due to motion sickness possibly.

I don’t think the Kinect hardware was good.  The camera resolution was 640×480.  I can’t imagine poor image detail did much to help the software implementation.

Not having a reference device actually really hurts the ability to prototype though. I have some stuff I’d love to test DXR for… but I can’t because I don’t have RT hardware in my development laptop. I realize that RT on CPUs is extremely expensive (I’ve run PoVRAY before) but it’s still very doable. Even below a single FPS I think it’s worthwhile for validation and testing of code at a minimum.
