Hi! Why not just work with bytes and use lookup tables? Is it slower?

I don’t have easy access to an AArch64 system for performance testing
You could test it on QEMU for Windows.

Emulators can be used for functional testing (assuming its implementation is correct), but hardly for performance testing. Emulators can also choose to not implement advanced instruction sets, or simulate with software.

Easier said than done. Few days ago I wanted to test my code on big endian machine. I managed to install Debian 11 for PowerPC 32bit into QEMU for Windows. … Only to find out that it cannot boot from hard drive. Grub failed to install probably because write to BIOS/NVRAM is not allowed/implemented in QEMU or the installer doesn’t know how to do it correctly.
Any tips how to get working big endian environment (with networking, git and GCC) on Windows are welcome.

If you compile the code targeting Linux, you can use QEMU to run the ELF binary as a user mode process instead of emulating a full system.

Yeah, but I need to have a Linux system for it to work. … Which means running my app inside user space QEMU emulator, running inside Linux OS, running inside VirtualBox/VMWare/HyperV/QEMU running on Windows running on my laptop. I can manage to do that, it is just a lot of annoying work. If you want to contact me, I’m on Twitter/Reddit/GitHub, I don’t use any nick names.

Oh, that’s pretty much my area of specialization. I’d be happy to discuss it with you in a proper forum, where we can exchange unlimited messages and screenshots. And I’m absolutely confident that Mr. Chen won’t have any problem whatsoever with QEMU.
