Java had a similar problem with their “properties” format, which despite being used for localisation since the beginning, was defined as 7-bit ASCII… requiring either a build step to transform sensibly-encoded files into a mess of escape characters, or writing your own frontend to deal with IO and encodings, bypassing the actual ResourceBundle classes.
Fortunately in later Java versions, they’ve taken the intelligent step of declaring that the encoding is actually UTF8… retaining compatibility, while bringing sanity to the default behaviour.

How does the API determine that the file “consists of Unicode characters”? I assume the answer is BOM, but you didn’t mention it.

(If I may speculate…)
An INI file will always have to start with an ASCII character, either ‘;’ marking a comment or ‘[‘ introducing a section. (I’d be interested to learn if that assertion I made is actually correct.)
Read the first two bytes and look for NUL bytes. If neither are NUL then its ASCII-only. If there’s one, it’s UTF-16 and you know the byte order.
(Edited. The original stated that ‘#’ marked a comment.)

I see that Raymond answered it in the linked page.
> the code determines this is through our favorite dodgy API – IsTextUnicode. (The BOM serves as a big hint.)

What do you think about UTF8? I developed a programmable VST plugin and supported UTF8 for configuration and instrument files, that can store some strings (the language tokens are ANSI characters only). I developed UTF8 helpers like SendMessageU8, that, unsurprisingly, converts to UTF16 and calls SendMessageW.

Rip Michael Kaplan, I read most of his blogs in the days, nice to see him being remembered

Rip. His blog was, like this one is, an excellent source of knowledge.
Once you understand the why, the what makes sense. And Michael was great for that. I read it in real time, and reference it all the time still.

So if I create an “empty” file consisting of just the UTF-8 BOM, is that enough to make all INI operations on the file use Unicode and preserve the BOM?
