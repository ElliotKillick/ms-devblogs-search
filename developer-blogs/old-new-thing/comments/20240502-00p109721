I mean, std::vector<bool> is only a bad move for writers of generic code (and for new generic code you shouldn’t hard-code std::vector anyway, instead you should use range concepts). It’s exceedingly unlikely that the consumer of this code will specifically require forming a pointer or reference to a bool, so there’s no downside to using std::vector<bool> here.

It will become a problem later: Since you cannot form a reference to a bool, updating unrelated elements from different threads would require a mutex to avoid data races.
