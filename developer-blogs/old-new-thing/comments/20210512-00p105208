Why does Explorer use the term KB instead of KiB? (June 11th, 2009)
We don´t use it because anybody use it, what a mediocre excuse.
The purpose is not feeling superior, is to use the correct term, to teach or educate people.
I will give you an example of why its a bad ide to ignore wrong usage of information:
In one job training I had some years ago, the trainer took us a math exam, and in 2 excercises the correct option wasn´t there (like this 5-4x3+8/6), I made an observation to the trainer about my recent discovery, emphasizing that...Read moreWhy does Explorer use the term KB instead of KiB?

And after all, I´ll give you an excuse:
Today, Apple and Linux uses the binary units, so, why Windows, 12 YEARS AFTER YOUR ORIGINAL COMMENT!!, has not implemented it yet?
Yes, I looked for another recent blog of yours just to reply the oldest one, I just can´t stop the urge to comment my concerns.
I don´t know you, and maybe you´re a great developer and person, but I can´t bear this kind of “ARGUMENTS”.
Regards from México.

It's for backwards-compatibility, and because of tradition and convention. Take your pick. Binary units came around much later to differentiate things to stop non-tech people from being confused as to why their storage has less space than advertised or why their network connections were slower than promised. Tech people have been using and understanding the context for decades without problem (incidentally, even a "byte" wasn't eight bits for a while, it has had various values, in fact, IBM originally defined it as seven bytes).
Also,when binary units were standardized, storage and screen space were still at a premium, so putting that...Read moreIt’s for backwards-compatibility, and because of tradition and convention.

Also,when binary units were standardized, storage and screen space were still at a premium, so putting that extra ‘i’ in every unit was too costly to bother when most people got by just fine without it (again, tech people knew what it meant). It’s the same reason that two-digit years were being used, leading to the Y2K bug.
(That math problem smacks of “viral math problems” that are another example of why social-media was a mistake. 😒)

I would be curious if the end result can be made to match the productivity that can be achieved using C++/CX or C++ Builder instead, regarding the amount of required boilerplate code to deal with COM.
