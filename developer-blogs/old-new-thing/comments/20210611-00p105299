Isn’t “load” and “store” just another way of saying “read” and “write”?

The advantage of “load” and “store” is that they are unambiguous.  In a load operation, you read data from memory and write it to the register.  In a store operation, you read data from the register and write it to memory.  If you just say “read” which of these do you mean?  Reading from a register or reading from memory?
