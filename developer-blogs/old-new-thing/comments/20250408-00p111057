Anti-malware software IS the malware. It‚Äôs a universal backdoor just like Windows Update, an intolerable security risk.

Counter-evidence:
Living Windows 3.1 software has stability beyond normal. This is due to the fact the unstable software died out already leaving only the stable.

What living win 3.1 software is there anymore? You can‚Äôt even run win16 code anymore on modern (64 bit) CPUs.

You have no running 16 bit code anymore.
I have cross-mounted hard disks with VMs running 16 bit code that do useful work.

Some win32 stuff has been broken over the years, particularly shell related APIs. But even so, you are right it‚Äôs the most stable gui api known to man, at least one that‚Äôs os native.
Given how things are going that‚Äôs probably a reason to expect it to be killed off sooner rather than later üôÅ

The title made me think about stable platforms.
That's something I talk quite a lot about, because there is one computing platform that beats all competition by huge margins: Classic Win32 (which is typically 64-bit these days, but still).
I have been programming (in Delphi) for Win32 since the late 90s, and I find it truly amazing that the apps I wrote back then still run perfectly on Windows 11. And the programming techniques and APIs have not changed much either; in fact, the GDI painting that my 90s app did back then still works the same way in Windows 11.

And the programming techniques and APIs have not changed much either; in fact, the GDI painting that my 90s app did back then still works the same way in Windows 11.
Compared to most other platforms, this is outstanding or even exceptional. For instance, last week I discovered that a fairly new Android app (from 2017, which in my mind is very recent) is not compatible with new Android devices, and a lot of APIs have changed too, so not even recompiling helps.
This is one reason why I love Win32. If I make a Win32 app today, I know it will work exactly the same way 20 or 30 years from now. If I make an Android app, I don‚Äôt even know if it will be usable next year‚Ä¶ And I don‚Äôt need to learn new APIs every year. I just do my usual BitBlt, MessageBox, SendMessage, and WaitForMultipleObjects stuff.
And then there‚Äôs the software quality aspect. Maybe that‚Äôs just me, but my impression is that quality Win32 software just works, all the time, every time. If I make a carefully designed and tested Win32 app, it will just work without bugs or quirks. Not 99% of the time, but 100%. And it doesn‚Äôt matter how much I ‚Äútorture test‚Äù the app using random mouse and keyboard input: the UI never ever gets into an invalid state. On the other hand, my impression with modern (mobile-style) apps is that they typically are unstable, quirky, and buggy. Apps hang and crash; you get ‚Äúspinners‚Äù that never stop, etc. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs because of the platform per se or because there are simply less experienced developers on the mobile (or ‚Äúapp‚Äù) arena, but I do see a big difference in software quality.
I just love Win32 and hope that Microsoft realises how important this platform is.
I want to do my usual BitBlt, MessageBox, SendMessage, and WaitForMultipleObjects stuff even as I grow old.

My sentiment exactly.
It's just sad that Microsoft tries to keep reinventing new and new APIs and frameworks, and then abandoning them, when the great stable multiplatform one is right under their noses. Too bad there's probably only Raymond here left at Microsoft, out of all the programmers who could maintain and potentially extend this layer.
Should Microsoft ever decide to un-abandon Win32 and do some substantial improvements on this layer, I'm offering to work on it FOR FREE.
I even have a wish list, but let's make some proper Common Controls vNext, rework Dark Mode properly, fix Fibers and AVX, etc....Read moreMy sentiment exactly.

I agree, this is something I was thinking about just yesterday. What‚Äôs even more fascinating is that with Wine, these apps can even be run on Linux, a system known to have issues running binaries compiled elsewhere.

I'd guess that Microsoft almost single-handedly created this phenomenon, with windows itself.
Also, at least for Windows the goldilocks "zone" keeps on getting older and older. I've given up hope Microsoft will release a "good" windows to replace w11  before w10 is killed for good, but if I had my real choice I'd be back on 7 today.
Of course it's not clear that the Goldilocks zone can be objectively measured; much of it seems subjective; eg some people actually seem to like windows 11.  But the lack of enthusiasm to upgrade in the face of w10 (or...Read moreI‚Äôd guess that Microsoft almost single-handedly created this phenomenon, with windows itself.

I recall Goldilocks broke into a house with three Bears. Each bear liked their porridge at a specific temperature. The Father Bear liked it hot, the Mother bear liked it cool and the baby bear liked it midway which was ‚Äòjust right‚Äô ‚Äì so Goldilocks ate the baby bear‚Äôs porridge. In reality, the three bears would have eaten Goldilocks as a second course to their meal.
