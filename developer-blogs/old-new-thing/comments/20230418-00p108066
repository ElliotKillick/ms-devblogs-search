@Mystery Man (for some reason - maximum depth? - I don't see a reply link for your latest comment, which is of course the one I want to reply to):

No need to imply any cause in Mr. Chen’s writing style, which has always been cautious about revealing any identifying information. Indeed it seems to me that it has become slightly less so over time.

Mystery Man stated themselves their questions are rhetorical. Their writing style makes it seem like hiding provocations as facts behind that declaration to the uninitiated, but it at least makes clear they don’t need to be answered nor have a meaningful answer.

> the Taskbar team gets a bug report with a lot of Setup and Update logs in it. To be fair, this is understandable from the customer’s point of view: The last interesting thing they did was update the system, so in their mind, this is an update issue. I’m not sure what we can do to reduce this type of misunderstanding.
A good start would be to explain to users what you want them to do.  The Feedback Hub UI seems to be following the unfortunate design trend of "if less is more then none is best": https://www.digitalcitizen.life/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/feedback_hub-15.png

A sentence above “Choose a category” that says something like “Select the category that best describes where the problem is or what feature isn’t working.” would help users know that you that want to know that the Taskbar is broken and not that they did an Update which caused a broken taskbar.  And if it asked whether the feedback was due to a problem or was a product suggestion or a question, you’d be able to make the category suggestion more appropriate to the circumstance.

I’ve reported a few bugs in Feedback Hub but haven’t seen the thank-you sign, is it new?
Also, the bug categories are pretty confusing.  Like, I once submitted a bug that you couldn’t navigate the emoji picker with dictation software – does that go to accessibility or shell? Stuff like that.

I have been using the Feedback Hub since Win 10 and I always get the thank you picture of the team. It should show up on the same page that thanks you for the feedback and notes they won’t respond to you. But I’m using an English version of the OS so if you’re using a different version then maybe it is different??

Mr. Chen, do you have proof that this actually happened? For instance, could you please post a link to the tweet or the message requesting certification of appreciation?

For the purpose of this post, it doesn’t need to have happened. Raymond is describing how to (and how not to) report bugs to Microsoft, the errant Tweet being hypothetical (or not) doesn’t matter to that explanation.

You should read this blogs Ground Rules first before asking something Raymond really doesn’t need to do.

And so, my courteous question receives a hostile reaction. The last time I checked the Code of Conduct document linked below, such hostile reactions were forbidden.
I am no alien to writing blog posts that do not disclose the identities of people involved. However, in those posts, the crux of the matter is something technical, not a comment on the conduct of those undisclosed individuals.
You know, Mr. Chen, instead of writing real-world accounts without shouldering the burden of proof, you could write fiction and be lauded as a fiction writer like Isaac Asimov.

You know, Mr. Chen, instead of writing real-world accounts without shouldering the burden of proof, you could write fiction and be lauded as a fiction writer like Isaac Asimov. All you have to do is to add a disclaimer at the top of this post and choose a name for the antagonist of this post.

Ray Koopa’s response wasn’t particularly hostile in my opinion. It just pointed you to the Ground Rules. I was actually afraid that I revealed *too much* information and that the tweet would be easy to find, so I’m somewhat heartened that you couldn’t find it. I’m not sure what proof would satisfy you, seeing as you could claim that I fabricated any internal communications.

It's remarkable how much fear governs most of your blogging conduct. You fear that you might have given too much info already. You're afraid that your proof might not be good enough for me. The other element in your blogging is omission. You even omit a publically viewable tweet.
If I had to guess, I'd say you've seen a case of outrageous behavior from a user and decided to write about it so that your readers empathize. But in doing so, you scrubbed every element that evoked the original emotion in you.

Omission and fear are traits of oppressive regimes. They constantly broadcast news items in the general form of “someone did something, but we’re not saying who.” After a while, they lose credibility. (Back in 2008, your blog posts received dozens of comments. What happened?)

And all this time I’ve thought that the right way to report a bug was to just tweet it where Jen Gentleman would see it.

I've run a couple of bug bounty programs.
They are incredibly time consuming. "Security researchers" would run Nessus or OWASP ZAP, find, and report a bug, then be upset when we told them we knew about it and it's just not (going to be?) fixed. I could never talk internal teams into just "fixing" everything the scanners found static analysis noise, the entire dev team wasn't exposed to bug bounty noise and I got serious pushback against making those scans part of CI. And I could never hand the tasks off to a PM because PMs were deemed "not technical enough"...Read moreI’ve run a couple of bug bounty programs.

I haven’t heard much about startups with bug bounty programs in a while.

Oh, don't get me started on would-be "security researchers"... a bunch of chimpanzees would be more useful than most of that lot. One of my jobs includes keeping an eye on the CVE reports for all of our third-party stack, and it's ridiculous how often some new "Critical" item appears on the list which on inspection leads to a bunch of exasperated developers who are left scrambling to respond to a complete non-issue.

There was a case a couple of years ago where someone had obviously just done some kind of code search across all of GitHub looking for some pattern, then logged hundreds of dodgy CVEs — most of which were poorly targeted, resulting in Python-related vulnerabilities being logged against popular Java frameworks like Spring. And between my wasted time, and that of all the other architects in my position across the world, and that of the upstream projects dealing with this crap… these morons have wasted a lot of other people’s time and money.
