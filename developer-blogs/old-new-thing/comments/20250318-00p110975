Keep in mind I suspect in practice Win9x CD boot was never popular for many reasons. (The few versions that supported it for example did it by floppy emulation)

“After my loan to the setup team ended, they realized that they could squeeze a miniature Windows 3.1 onto a single floppy and avoid having to write two setup programs. I think some of my original file copying code is still present in the GUI portion of Windows 95 setup, but probably not much any more.”
I wonder what was used to extract mini.cab.

This reminds me of the MS ban on HDD boot drives and Google.

I’ve recently been reading about the early days of Windows, and one thing mentioned was that Windows 1 and 2 were also available to developers as a stripped down runtime that was shipped alongside some applications, so that they were able to run without the user already having Windows installed.  I’m curious now if this is related technically to the miniature Windows 3 you mention here, or something different?

AFAIK this was based on Windows 3.1 standard mode.

AFAIK there were no bootable CDs. Not even OSR 2.5.

"It’s possible that later editions of Windows 95 did have a bootable CD, but I don’t know for sure."
They did. I haven't found an edition of Windows 95 other than the original Upgrade version that didn't have a bootable CD.
Don't overthink it though; the CD boot is El-Torito floppy with a bunch of CD drivers on the floppy disk that starts 95 Setup. I guess the idea was if the OEM CD does not work the OEM can use the floppy disk version of the OEM 95.

The only mini-95 that makes sense is unpack the system part of 95; stabilize the code to run without the registry initialized, and do hardware detect and optional components in 95. This means you do indeed stay in text mode for quite awhile but the disk package is one disk smaller. You don’t need a second reboot at the end though; an ExitWindowExec() call will suffice. ExitWindowsExec(“”) is apparently well-known to restart Windows.
