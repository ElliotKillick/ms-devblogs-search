“The system traces the I/O operations performed by an application when it starts up, and it uses this historical information the next time the application starts up”
where does the system store this information? I hope it’s not an evergrowing database of every exe I ran ever.

It’s a size-restricted database of the top 128 .exe files that you regularly run. Only the first 10 seconds of activity are monitored.
You can read more about it in Windows Internals by Pavel Yosifovich, et al.
