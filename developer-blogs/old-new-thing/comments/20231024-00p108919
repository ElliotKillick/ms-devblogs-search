It’s not just a particular artefact of the Windows cryptographic library, “abc” is a standard test string used for hash functions going back to at least MD5 in 1991.  Other standard hash-function test strings are “a”, “message digest”, “abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz”, and “abcdbcdecdefdefgefghfghighijhijkijkljklmklmnlmnomnopnopq”.  If you look for MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-2 hashes of those in other crypto libraries you’ll find those as well.
