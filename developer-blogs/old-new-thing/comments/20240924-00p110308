I’m surprised that this UserConsentVerifier class didn’t get multi-user API overloads, as Surface Hub and Xbox consoles are the key scenarios where you have multiple users signed in and collaborating (possibly with shared input devices), so you’d want to confirm that an individual user actually intended to do something risky.

I really hated when Chrome added a prompt like this for revealing saved passwords for the reasons you mention in this post… it’s very easy for users to assume their passwords are protected behind this prompt. But, you can go to the website in question, and let the password autofill, and use the browser dev tools to reveal it easily.
Honestly I have to say having this password prompt to reveal saved passwords feels like a security anti-pattern. It’s like a lock on your door, but it only works if someone doesn’t realize your ground-level windows are wide open.

I would have expected autofilled password fields to be poisoned until consent is given, so that devtools can’t just bypass that. Sounds like a bug in Chrome.
