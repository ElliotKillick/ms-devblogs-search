How I wish C++ just treated void as a regular type in many cases, at least for single instance occurrences (not bringing up the issue about what it means to have an array of void :b), without the need for specializations of something that would otherwise just work. Matt Calabrese had an interesting paper on that (p0146r1).

Raymond once covered what in C++ are dubbed “abominable functions”.  Search for it at your own mental risk.

This is the approach that is often used in C# code
 I have done it in c# code using a bool that gets ignored

I suppose the value of this over the previously detailed event that returns no result is for use in generic code.
Would be great if this article was not needed due to Regular void.  To me, an enthusiast but far from language expert, it makes so much sense to have void be a complete type and reduce the need for these special cases.
