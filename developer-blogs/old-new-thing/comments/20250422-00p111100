I feel truly sorry for people who have to put up with this rubbish every day.

I don’t — they tolerated BS from others instead of standing up and telling them how much they suck.
“what’s on my/his/her/their mind” already exists and it already implies present time and importance.
The reason those people were adding “top” to it is to imply that they have much more going on in there (which I sincerely doubt given the pathological need for pointless additional emphasis).
Should’ve ridiculed them instead of letting it pass.

Are you going to ridicule someone who can fire you?
