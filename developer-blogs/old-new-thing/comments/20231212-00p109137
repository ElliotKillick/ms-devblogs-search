Ah, but Japan Windows Commercial Support documents that order in a step and explains it to their customers.

There is also this limitation with environment variable assignments that I recall from bat-files:
@echo off
setlocal

(
set VAR1=foo
set VAR2=%VAR1%bar
)

echo %VAR2%

This will output ‚Äúbar‚Äù, not the expected ‚Äúfoobar‚Äù.
Has this kind of limitation been retained over the decades for legacy compatibility?

This is just how those ( ) blocks work, use delayed expansion if you need a value set there.

Oh, you are right, this whole thing:

It correctly prints "foobar".
This was so many years ago, I've forgotten the details.
I think this was covered in the Windows NT Workstation Resource Kit book, that would had been where I had studied this back then, because I looked now in my old Windows NT and Windows 2000 pocket reference books from O'Reilly that I still have left, and it's not mentioned in either of them.
