Golden rule:  Never suppress anything that you can’t do better.
Silently crashing or ending the program, or dumping a message box “Internal error!” (notice the very important exclamation mark) is not helpful. Then you start the annoying cycle of “we need more information” and “we cannot reproduce”, until you realize suppressing that message box wasn’t the wisest decision.
On the other hand, a well written text about which library is missing, why it’s needed and where to find it can make any customer happy.

Speaking of DOS errors, “This program cannot be run in DOS mode” is the best error, because it shows that the DOS legacy lives to this day.

Technically, that’s not an error as such, at least not an OS one.
The legacy in this case is the existence of an MS-DOS “MZ” executable at the beginning of a PE image. Linkers normally insert a stub program that simply prints this message and exits, but it could be any MS-DOS program.
I guess that makes PE a “fat binary” of sorts (supporting multiple OSes, rather than multiple architectures on one OS).
