I thought concurrency::task support was provided by pplawait.h anyway? Which based on what I’m seeing seems to properly support the new syntax albeit without using the right handle type… which hopefully STL and crew on the stdlib have already fixed.

The Visual Studio 2017 version of pplawait.h uses the pre-standardization free awaiter pattern. The Visual Studio 2019 version of pplawait.h uses the post-standardization awaiter-based pattern. This article is about recovering awaitability for people who are still using Visual Studio 2017.
