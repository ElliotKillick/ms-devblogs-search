These days new URL("https://ⓜicrosoft.coM").hostname seems to do some of the work for you, although not quite enough for the given use case.

Suppose my web site filters domain names
Excuse me? 😲 What in the name of heavens this customer is trying to do? More specifically, which component is filtering what? Let’s assume I did open “microsoft.com”; how did this customer expect to intercept my request in the first place, let alone filter it?
I think a huge chunk of the puzzle is missing here.

Sounds like they are trying to block access to certain domains (the microsoft.com is probably just an anonymization on Raymond’s part). A poor man’s version of something like McAfee Web Gateway that blocks access to certain categories of sites while on the workplace network.
Surely it’s cheaper and easier to implement your own vs buying a solution
