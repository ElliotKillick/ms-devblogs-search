I have used VirtualQuery as an alternative to IsBadXxxPtr, just because it won’t trip guard pages.  For C++ objects, you can also validate the vtable member to see if you were passed a bad pointer or not.
Obviously, you want to avoid bad pointers entirely, but sometimes people have time pressures, or are unwilling to try to fix other people’s code in an unfamiliar codebase.

I studied the Algol-derived systems programming language for one of those Burroughs computers, I think a B7700, for a brief time in the 1970’s. I wish we still had those hardware-enforced limits.
Maybe FPGAs can help?
And no, I’m not interested in managed languages. I want performance, and the only way to get that is by programming as close to the metal as possible.

Dear Raymond, please tell Adobe to supply more of those apps that use IsBadWritePtr to address their buffer overflows.Signed, (RedTeam) Hackers.

this seems to be an example of exactly what not to do. read the data size  and then read that much data into a fixed sized buffer in the stack. just perfect for exploitation!

Raymond, thanks for enabling the full blog entry text in RSS feed!

Is the whole world going to “most recent item on top”, like this blog software does?  I don’t like that choice… Even my bank does that online, and it just looks backwards.  Oh well.

A: Because it messes up the order in which people normally read text.
Q: Why is top-posting such a bad thing?
A: Top-posting.
Q: What is the most annoying thing in e-mail?

I don’t really mind people top-posting or bottom-posting. The bottomline is: just don’t mix it.
That’s why I hate Yahoo’s webmail a lot.

I observed the same behavior when I was viewing the blog while not logged in. However, once I logged in with my Microsoft Live account, it flipped to “oldest post first” mode. It also gives the option of logging in using a Google or Facebook ID.

The devs are working on it 🙂 Got an e-mail from one of them after sending some feedback saying that they are working on oldest-post-first, and that the “load more” (comments) button has been fixed! (And it seemingly has.)

I should have clarified– we’d like more than just a few generic segments for stack, code, and data– separate protections for each data structure would be nice.  Probably would require some hot segment-lookaside registers, so maybe as an option?

The way to get that has been to use a managed language. There are lots of choices of languages that enforce buffer sizes for you — though like Raymond says, only you know whether you want the program to truncate, raise an exception, or terminate on this kind of error.

Way back before Disco, a company named Burroughs came out with a mainframe computer with hardware-enforced addres limits on every array and structure.  Then in 1982, Intel took a cue from Rick Springfield's tune "Don't talk to Strangers", and they implemented a somewhat-limited version of Burroughs segments.   Microsoft thankfully embraced that memory model for a while, in the vaguely-supported 1989-era DPMI.  Some of us rewrote malloc() to use those hardware segments, and many buffer overflows were automatically and preemptively caught.
Howsomeever the hardware wasn't widely used, so Intel dropped those segments in the 386. I think.   Sigh.  How many billions...Read moreWay back before Disco, a company named Burroughs came out with a mainframe computer with hardware-enforced addres limits on every array and structure.

Intel, please bring back segments, at least as an option for picky systems and programmers!

Burroughs seem to have had invented and implemented all sorts of interesting and useful stuf… and then they went bankrupt and everyone forgot about them. Rather sad.

If I recall correctly, some ex US Treasurer merged Burroughs and Univac and stripped $400 million in cash out of them.  I don’t know what’s worse, giving yourself an unearned paycheck of that size, or merging such two incompatible companies.  Univac had like an 18-bit product line of computers for Navy ships and a 36-bit series for scientific and general business use, with 6 and 8-bit character sets.   Burroughs had a stack-based 48-bit machine with EBCDIC internally and ASCII external character sets.  Not exactly a marriage made in computer heaven.
