I always wondered why &MethodName syntax was invalidated in favor of &Class::MethodName.
After all, when you *call* a method you can use plain MethodName()

For the readers’ convenience, here are versions of the error printed by 4 different compilers.
Bonus chatter: dontcha think specifying an uninvoked c.InstanceMethod to be synonymous with
std::bind_front(&Class::InstanceMethod, std::ref(c))
would be pretty neat?

I see that clang actually has a readable diagnostic for this case; icc’s diagnostic seems less clear but it at least is suggesting that you forgot to call the function.
But for the case when you forgot to call a static method, then I like msvc’s diagnostic the best, followed by gcc and then clang (icc doesn’t even warn about this particular error).
