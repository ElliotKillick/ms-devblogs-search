I remember scoffing at ASLR when it first became a thing. The primary defenses are NX-stack and NX-heap.
I have also seen a self-relative write-what-where vulnerability. Such a beast completely bypasses ASLR of itself; now itâ€™s just a matter of gadgets again. In the Linux world they did close this class using something called relro which took away the activation path to get it to actually _do_ anything.
