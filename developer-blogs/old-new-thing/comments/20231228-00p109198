I noticed that https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/mfc/reference/connection-maps has been updated to reflect this, except that the sample code still has FALSE for this parameter… how is one supposed to know if/when/how many times to call Release on the sink? Is “proper weak reference” an oblique reference to the WIL or what else…?
