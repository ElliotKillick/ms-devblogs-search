Not the person mentioned, but several years ago I have noticed that permissions are only set to C:\Program Files\WindowsApps but enumerating files still works.
In OneCommander file manager (I am dev) if you paste path in address bar like
C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\44576milosp.OneCommander_3.21.1.0_neutral__p0rg76fmnrgsm
you can access files from the package and browse packages from all other store apps, but as Raymond said, not modifiable and also nothing “useful” in them

I guess it’s my turn to wear the tinfoil hat.
