How is this presented to the user?
It would be nice if there was a tooltip that explained what kind of date it is when you hover the mouse pointer over it.
Also, if all files in a folder are the same kind, the column name could reflect that.

Why not DateReleased for mp3?

Of course, the real question is how you programmatically ask which underlying property the shell picked this time.

If you care, then don’t use PKEY_ItemDate. Use one of the explicit dates. The purpose of PKEY_ItemDate is “Give me a date that is most likely to match what the user considers to be the date of the thing.”

Who would be interested in anything other than Date Modified. Nice with some shell stuff, i missed the “real” win32 articles 🙂

For TV and pictures, the date from metadata makes more sense than some minor modification to the file or media container.
DateAcquired I don’t agree with however. I care a lot more about when a song was released, not when I purchased it. MSDN says “For example, this data is used as the main sorting axis for the virtual folder New Music, which enables people to browse the latest additions to their collection.” which makes sense for such a specific folder but not for files in generic folders.

Most songs don’t have it. Music metadata and MP4 format provision for a Year field but no app puts a year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and millisecond in there. Imagine looking at your music and thinking, “Gee, why do these musicians always release on the midnight of the first of January?”

Some tag with the full ISO date. Either way, the point is to sort roughly by release date, especially when dealing with a single artist.

And that explains why displaying “Date” in a newly opened Shell folder can take so long if it contains video files for example, it’s because the Shell (or maybe some 3rd party extensions) goes spelunking into the item’s metadata to determine the “Date”. If you un-choose that “Date” column and choose DateModified instead, everything is faster, but maybe makes less sense 🙂
