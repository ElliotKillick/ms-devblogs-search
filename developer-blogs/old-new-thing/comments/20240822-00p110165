Ad naming, I would have thought that IActivationFactory would be a factory for activations.

So RoGetActivationFactory is to IActivationFactory as CoGetClassObject is to IClassFactory?

I think the big thing to remember is that, just like the object returned through CoGetClassObject doesn’t necessarily have to allow the creation of an instance through IClassFactory (there is the predefined IClassFactory2, and custom factory interfaces can be defined), the object returned through RoGetActivationFactory doesn’t have to allow the creation of an instance through IActivationFactory.
But in general, both of these functions are used to retrieve the so called factory object for the coclass/runtimeclass.
