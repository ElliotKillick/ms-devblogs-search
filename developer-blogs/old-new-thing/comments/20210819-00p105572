The default I-beam cursor is still an inverting cursor, unlike most of the other default cursors. This works with Remote Desktop, but occasionally I need to remote desktop to an intermediate computer and then remote desktop from there to the final computer. Annoyingly, the inverting cursor no longer works in this case, and it simply disappears, so I have to temporarily have to choose an alternative opaque cursor.

It would be nice if this progress was documented on GetSystemMetrics, which entries lost their meaning and in which version.
The same, since 2015, I’m hoping for a proper documentation on Taskbar button icon size, since that’s changed, so that vast majority of apps don’t end up with blurred icon. If changing SM_CXICON to 24 is too breaking, then add something like SM_CXTASKBARICON, and document it in WNDCLASSEX, or something like that.
