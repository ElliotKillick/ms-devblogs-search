In my experience, talking with people rarely works; I‚Äôve filed countless bug-reports for various programs and websites and reported countless fraudulent listings on eBay and so on, but they usually just they end up being ignored or rejected. Unfortunately, most of the time, the only way to get things done is to just burn down the shed. ü§∑

‚Ä¶ at which point the police would arrest and incarcerate you for arson. Rumor has it that in the American prison, other prisoners forcibly reconfigure your face, the painful way.
On a more serious note, when more than one developer rejects your bug reports, it is high time you realized there is something wrong with your reports.

Your second paragraph is quite naive.

Microsoft rejects bugs because they don‚Äôt want to put in the effort. This means your test is poor. Elsewhere I get better response rate and actual fix rate. But sometimes it just doesn‚Äôt get fixed. I remember this one where the musl-libc developers and the glibc developers were each telling the other they were wrong about what a library function should do.

It seems like outsourced support reps are either incentivized to close cases or are penalized for letting an issue get escalated.  It's very frustrating when it's so obvious the rep's goal is to discard my case as fast as possible.  Then some teams are happy to let cases languish forever.  I've got one case with a firewall vendor that's been open almost a year now because they deemed a satisfactory work-around is to delete all of the rules and re-renter them by hand from scratch.

I‚Äôve had arguments like that.
min(x,y) should return the smallest value.
What if they‚Äôre equal? I‚Äôve had arguments over whether a=1; b=1; c=min(a,b); should return a or b.

Does that ‚Äòmin‚Äô take in and return references? Otherwise why would it matter?

Easy. Just let them supply their own compare function to it. The choice of ‚Äú<" and "<=" will enable them to decide whether to return a or b.
At least that's how LINQ solved this kind of problem.

if (vfork() == 0) { setuid(2); exec(‚Ä¶); } dreadlocks on musl long. I submitted a one line patch that was rejected. Then the musl and glibc devs argued over whether or not that sequence is defined.
