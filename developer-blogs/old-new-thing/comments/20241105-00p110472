Although one can argue, compellingly, that from an end user perspective having the two sliders on the same tab is far more usable.
I can recall using at least one if not two computers where I made use of this scrolling virtual screen setup to have 4x the desktop space (2×2). It was very handy, although modern virtual desktops are more usable I think. And multiple monitors wins hands down.

I think that screenshot from Bob Pony is only visible when you’re logged in at Twitter. I don’t seen anything, and following the link I get a request to login.

Weird. I didn’t. Anyways, web archive to the rescue: https://web.archive.org/web/20241106131014/https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GRvvZRHXYAAFqKa?format=png&name=small

I’ve used a driver that did this on Windows 95. They did of course release a new version which was more compatible with Windows 98 by removing the feature. I did try that version but I didn’t like it for some reason so as I wasn’t planning on upgrading to Windows 98 I stuck with the Windows 95 version.

If my memory is not wrong, I have seen this long ago. The desktop can scroll like a RTS game. I guess the video card driver was special to enable this.
