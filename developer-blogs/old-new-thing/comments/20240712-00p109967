Raymond, you missed a fantastic opportunity to end this post with “Task failed successfully.”

For anyone who wants to do this sort of thing when there’s no do-nothing await operation like the cancellation token, you can use an Immediately Invoked Lambda Expression instead to fabricate a valid expression for co_return, even if the return type is void:
co_return [&]() -> return_type { throw error; }();
Since the co_return is there, it forces the function to be a coroutine, but since the lambda unconditionally throws an exception, it never actually has to provide a return value.
