DirectUIHWND vs SysListView32
Off-topic and my apologies for that but I have no other choice.
After unsuccessfully scouring the net I still need to know what
method I should use to replace the list-view macro ListView_GetHotItem
when the control is a DirectUIHWND.
With best wishes.

DUI is undocumented. If you are trying to manipulate the desktop or file list in Explorer, use IShellWindows, IFolderView, etc.

Yes thank you, in the meantime I found the following lead from the old MSDN journals.
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2000/march/windows-2000-ui-innovations-enhance-your-user-s-experience-with-new-infotip-and-icon-overlay-shell-extensions
”To build this extension you need to create a COM inproc server that implements
IQueryInfo and IPersistFile.
IQueryInfo is required to provide the runtime text to the shell.
IPersistFile is used by Explorer to let the extension know about the specific file currently under the
mouse pointer.”
