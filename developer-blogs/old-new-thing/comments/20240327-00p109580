When for example I try to view a password stored in Google Chrome, I get a popup saying ‚ÄúGoogle Chrome is trying to show passwords. Type your Windows password to allow this.‚Äù
Is there an API that allows decryption to work only if the user provides their password/fingerprint/etc? Similar to how you have to re-enter a password on websites even if you are logged it when doing major things like changing your password

That‚Äôs what the CryptProtectData/CryptUnprotectData function does.
It is an API that allows decryption to work only if the user provides their password/fingerprint/etc.
In fact: that‚Äôs how *all* encryption works ‚Äì you cannot access the encrypted data unless you provide the key (e.g. password, fingerprint, etc)

I believe what Doyon meant was to force an on-spot re-authentication. Of course, when the user is logged on, the user must have been authenticated.
The fact that Google Chrome (or any other sane browser) can fill in a saved password in a website without forcing the user to retype the password implies that the process does not need re-authentication to decrypt --- the key is available to any process running under the identity of that user (this is the traditional security model of a desktop system, where the security boundary is user identity, not process). The prompt is purely theatrical.

More like the traditional security model of a 70s' mainframe :)
PS: In principle, a browser can choose to implement password auto-fill using the operating system's keyring, which could in turn require the user to reauthenticate in order to hand out the stored passwords. In this case, the password prompt would not be purely theatrical (at least not from the browser's point of view).
Of course, exactly how password saving is implemented is completely up to the author of the browser's code, though if the OS keyring is not used then the saved credentials become extremely prone to getting snooped by processes...Read moreMore like the traditional security model of a 70s‚Äô mainframe üôÇ

Sure, it‚Äôs possible to make the prompt meaningful (and the implementation is more secure), but that‚Äôd be at the pain of having to re-authenticate at every password auto-fill. If the user happens to use face/iris recognition and Ctrl+Alt+Delete is not required to enter a credential, then OK; otherwise I doubt the user base for such a secure system.
Alas, once the password is filled into the web page, it‚Äôs again prone to other processes‚Äô access ‚Äî unless we revamp how password auto-fill works.

When you say ‚Äúon the same machine‚Äù, what exactly does machine refer to?
If the machine is a VM does it matter if the host changes?
Can I reinstall Windows between encrypting and decrypting? Can I update Windows?

The machine-wide keys are held in the ‚ÄúSystem‚Äù account.
As long as you don‚Äôt delete and re-create that account you can decrypt the data.
That includes reinstalling Windows.

So the keys are in Windows and if I'm running a VM, the keys are with the VM instance, not the host machine. If I start two instances of the same VM image, both will have the same keys, correct?
How are the keys preserved when reinstalling Widows? If I format my disk and reinstall Windows, why would the System account have the same keys again? Are they deterministically derived from the hardware?  Does it require some type of TPM continuity through the machine changes?
For the "same user on the same machine" scenario, does each user account have a set...Read moreSo the keys are in Windows and if I‚Äôm running a VM, the keys are with the VM instance, not the host machine. If I start two instances of the same VM image, both will have the same keys, correct?

I think the ‚Äúthat‚Äù is ‚Äúdelet[ing] and re-creat[ing] [the ‚ÄòSystem‚Äô] account‚Äù, so reinstalling Windows will make previously machine-encrypted content undecryptable.
I‚Äôm not sure what ‚Äúmachine‚Äù means in the domain setting. In Active Directory, joined workstations have accounts. Does the AD account store the machine keys? If I reuse a computer account when joining a reinstalled workstation, does it grant the rejoined installation ability to decrypt content encrypted before reinstallation?
