Does the “Install apps from any source, including loose files” toggle now also affect SYMBOLIC_LINK_FLAG_ALLOW_UNPRIVILEGED_CREATE, which previously required Developer Mode?

Though I believe Windows Setup installs the Microsoft-Store-signed version, it doesn’t have to do it in this way. Since Setup runs with administrative privilege, it can temporarily toggle the setting, deploy the appx, then revert the setting. Once installed, it seems Windows doesn’t bother verifying where the app came from when running it. I found a while ago that Adobe Reader DC MSI does this to sideload their Notification Manager app.

The second option has another problem: It combines only (restrictive) with other (additive).
You created this problem when you faked the Settings dialog box. The genuine Setting screen in Windows 10 v1909 says "Install apps from other sources that you trust, like your workplace." There is no "only" in the genuine sentence.
The above Settings page is already out of date. Starting in Windows 10 build 18956...
Does the grammarian in you not disapprove of using "already" for a Windows build that is not even released yet? The latest released build of Windows 10 is 18363. (That's Windows 10 v1909.)

Given that the current insider preview build is Build 19619.1000, I think it’s fair to say that a build after 18956 is very much released.
Sure it might not be available for everyone, but if you go by that argument, neither is 18363 “released” yet.

Perhaps from his perspective as a Windows developer “already” is appropriate.  Build 18956 may be in his rear view and he’s working on newer builds.

“The canteen only serves fish on Fridays.”
1. On Fridays if you don’t want to eat fish then you are out out of luck.
2. If it’s not Friday, you can’t get fish from the canteen.
3. Humans aren’t served on Fridays.
