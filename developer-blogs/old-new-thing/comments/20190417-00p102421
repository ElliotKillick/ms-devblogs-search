You’re so wrong. Perfmon use scale only when it comes to graph lines or other graph types. Avg, min, max value are absolute. You can set any scale in perfmon, but it’ll have no affect on this numbers, just change where line will be on Y-axis.

I assume the numbers above were fabricated, and are just shown as an example. It would be too much of a coincidence for them to be multiples of e and pi.

Pretty much every number Raymond uses in all of his posts are derived from e, pi, or √2. He’s been using them as his example ticket numbers and the like for a very long time.

It’s a handy way to say “This is a fake number, for demonstration purposes only,” when I want to anonymize data.
