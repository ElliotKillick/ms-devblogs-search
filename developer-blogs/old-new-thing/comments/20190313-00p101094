Thanks Raymond, for at least giving us some explanation about the design
You mentioned that OneDrive started using a separate column for status, but did you know that this is only when On-Demand option is turned on?
If it is off, it still uses overlay icons, 7 of them, in the latest update.
Also do you have any recommendation for older version of windows, like windows 8.1 ?

Is it planned to provide 3rd party dev’s like Dropbox, TortoiseGit, etc. access to the new Status column? Would be greater, if other dev’s could use that feature too.

It’s been available since Windows 10 Version 1709. There’s even a sample

How can the user see the status though if they don’t use the “details” view, but e.g. “large icons” (as for folders that contain pictures)?

Ah, I like the column solution better as well. Did your team give them this advice, or did they come to it themselves? Now I hope Dropbox does it as well.

Also, the comments are sorted the wrong way around (new to old, which does not really help when trying to follow what people are saying), and there seems no way to sort them the other way around. (And I get a script error when I post a comment, something about grecaptcha not being defined).

I know you probably can’t do anything about it Raymond, but I’ll say it anyway: the ‘load more’ button at the botom of the comments is visible even when there are no ‘more’ comments to show.

As for “What happens if an old program encounters a file in the new format?”, it crashes.
In GDI+ of Win7(Vista also?) they added support for a new way to specify the timeline of animated GIF.
In the old way (the way WinXP supports) the value is on PropertyItem 0x5100 (FrameDuration) of the frame. The new way involves setting time value on FrameDimension.Time.
Try resizing animated GIFs with new method then open the generated GIF on application WinXP cause it to crash. (The same application running on Win7 has no problem)

Yes, many things likely don’t work in WinXP.  Or in Windows 3.1 either….  Technically those are operating systems, not applications, but the operating systems had default applications for displaying GIFs.

The additional column is an elegant solution.

I’ll be completely off-topic.
Think I saw the change between new/old layouts. I wonder how many of your HTML/CSS screenshots are broken because of the new layout. Personally I find the new layout less conveying — the titles are truncated on the index page. BTW I’m impressed by the energy MS invested to create the SharePoint ad…

Very interesing, thanks. How can you create a column like “Status” and make it display by default ?
PS: The link sitting in a far-away leaf branch redirects to the home page (a little dust)

Yeah, the redirects are still a little wonky. The migration team is working on it, hoping to have a solution in a day or so.
