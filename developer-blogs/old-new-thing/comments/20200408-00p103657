Case: raised on background thread, executes synchronously on other background thread. Why? Thread raising thread is MTA and executing thread is STA. There’s no way to declare MTA->STA temporarily on a thread even though this makes logical sense. (The call we’re inside of isn’t reentrant anyway.) Since the STA thread didn’t have anything else to do, I used a pair of events and a pair of global variables for the handoff.

> That box makes no sense. […] Why would you do that?
I actually had to do that for several different reasons in the past:
– To get out of the UI thread so that COM objects you create aren’t bound to it.
– To make a cross apartment call and prevent COM message pumping making things reentrant when the caller doesn’t expect it.
Though luckily getting on a background thread is really easy, so not a problem.
