I assumed that there was a reason that their reference version used std::address_of rather than &, which rather defeats the point of removing the reference version.

Maybe, but it’s usually just done as a “good practice” thing in generic template code, even if the surrounding codebase doesn’t have any overloaded unary ampersand operators.

IMHO this should’ve been caught by the submitter directly during debugging. Stepping through the code to the actual API call would’ve shown quite clearly which route the flow went.
If you have issues calling an API, make sure to only complain if you can prove that the intended values are actually passed to the actual API call.

It was indeed caught directly during debugging. This was the investigation into why the wrong pointer was being passed.
