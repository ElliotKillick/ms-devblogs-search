IMO, even when the programming language allows, using the same name for both type and variable as asking for trouble, much like when the programming language is case sensitive, you use variable and type name in different casing. (Iâ€™ve seen people use ALL-CAPS for type names, and PascalCase for variable names)
I choose to use TClassName or typeClassName convension.

Every time I have to write `struct stat` I cry a little. I always feel like someone 30+ years ago was so smug that C had different namespaces for functions and structures that they felt compelled to embed this gem in the Unix API, and now we are stuck with it.
