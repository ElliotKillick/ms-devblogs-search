Many thanks for the article.
It is quite hard to ignore COM, even for .NET development, when Windows team to this day insists in making COM only APIs.
And it is as easy to deal with them in C++/WinRT, as it was in ATL before .NET came to be.
C++/CLI and C++/CX made it less painful, but apparently not a path the Windows team cares too much about.
So in the end we have to care about COM, even unwilling.
