Left = -Right.

I think you're assuming the series is monotonically changing. That's not the problem as you stated it.
What does your algo do with this sequence:  1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1 with target 3?
First pick the middle. The value is 1, which is to the left of 3, so go right . . . but then you won't find the 3 because it's in the left subseries.

I think instead that the not-clearly stated thing is that whatever sample you choose, if it's not the target then the target is no less than |choice_value - target_value|...Read moreI think you‚Äôre assuming the series is monotonically changing. That‚Äôs not the problem as you stated it.

I think instead that the not-clearly stated thing is that whatever sample you choose, if it‚Äôs not the target then the target is no less than |choice_value ‚Äì target_value| away, so you can skip to hat many away before taking your next sample in whichever direction you‚Äôre headed.
I‚Äôd just start at index 0 (because I‚Äôm simple) and hop/skip/jump my way up. In my stupid example, that finds 3 on the second step. I didn‚Äôt mean to make the example do that ‚Äì I was just trying to show how your algo didn‚Äôt work. üòâ
At any rate, it will find the value and it will be sublinear because of all the hopping.

One of the puzzle conditions is ‚Äúthe value you‚Äôre looking for is between the first and last values of the sequence (inclusive),‚Äù so in your sample sequence ‚Äú1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2‚Äù, the target value would have to be 1 or 2, not 3.

‚Äú1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4‚Äù satisfies all the conditions that were given. Now how do you find 3?

It doesn‚Äôt matter what the rounding algorithm is, so let‚Äôs just say we round down if there are an even number of elements remaining. There are 10 elements to start, so the midpoint is the fifth element, which is 1. That is too low, so focus on elements 6 to 10. The midpoint of that is element 8, whose value is 2. Still too low, so focus on elements 9 and 10. The midpoint element is number 9, whose value is (yay) 3.

Please remove the last element in my sequence. Typo which threw everything off. My points are still ok, I think.
