I would imagine that the phrase “click stop” comes from the Windows UI development term “tab stop”, where instead you press tab to navigate through the locations, you click through the slides to reach them.

It’s funny that “Pencils down” is the other Microspeak post you linked to, because “pencils down” is exactly what I guessed “click stop” meant when I was trying to figure it out at the start of the article. i.e. Click stop = stop clicking = stop working (although programmers would probably type more than click, but in general people would click around in a UI to do things).

It’s unfortunate that the Microspeak terms more often than not serve to hinder communication, and to socially ostracize those who are not “with it”, than to enhance dialog.  It’s even worse when these terms “break out” of the Microsoft campus into the wider business world.  I think I’ll stick to “milestone”, thanks.

If it wasn’t for Raymond regaling us with tales of them, we’d never hear 99% of them outside of the stray interview or Ted talk.

I wouldn’t worry about it. Microsoft-coined terminology never gets popular. The only exception so far has been Microsoft’s incorrect use of “x86” to refer to “IA-32” and sometimes “ARM 32-bit”. But other than that, whenever you see someone saying “inbox” instead of “built-in”, you know he or she is a Microsoft employee.
