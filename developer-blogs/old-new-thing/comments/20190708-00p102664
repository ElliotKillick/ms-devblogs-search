Too bad the blog ratings are gone since this is going to be one of those 5 star series.
With a some changes I got this working on VS2005, anyone dare to go older?

In the next-to-last paragraph, I think you meant “from inside the ::awesome::detect namespace”.
Small nit-pick: this could fail if someone declared a special in the global namespace. Depending how unique the “special “identifier is, this could be a problem.

Yup, thanks, and the second half of that paragraph was also wrong. In the case where somebody declared a special in the global namespace, you will at least get a compiler error telling about the problem.
