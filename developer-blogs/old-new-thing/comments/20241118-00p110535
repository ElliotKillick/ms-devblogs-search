The reason the std::map [] operator is so bad is due to a language deficiency. To fix it, add an operator[]=.

It’s a bad idea to use a global solution for a local problem.
Also, this may change the behavior of existing code. Code that originally called operator[] now calls operator[]=, and may have completely different behavior.
