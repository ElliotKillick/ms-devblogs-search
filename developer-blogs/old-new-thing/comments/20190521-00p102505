The literal translation of sidecar into danish is “sidevogn”, which in danish always refers to an additional shot of alcohol to your drink – but it’s not a secret code due to liquor laws or anything, just something people call it. I was not aware that there actually was a cocktail called sidecar. (You would probably also be asked which shot you wanted unless it was obvious due to some special offer or something)

Are there general guidelines about which HRESULT values should be propagated and which ones should be transformed, e.g. if CopyFile2 returns an error? E_OUTOFMEMORY, E_UNEXPECTED, E_FAIL, and HRESULT_FROM_WIN32(ERROR_DISK_FULL) are surely OK to propagate. I think E_INVALIDARG, HRESULT_FROM_NT(STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER_2), and anything in FACILITY_ITF should be transformed because they would mislead the caller if propagated.
