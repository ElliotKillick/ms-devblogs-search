Bindings in xaml and c#, in WPF for instance, are very powerful yet relatively straightforward. This shipped originaly in 2007 I think… when looking at web frameworks or even narive, I wouldn’r say they have caught up entirely…

Holy cow, it’s just impossible to add a comment to appropriate branch of discussion from smartphone without some magic and accidentally unintentionally deleting one’s own previous comments. Is this commenting stuff written in C# at the backend?
Anyway, as a reply to that question about the scariness of using XAML markup in 2025, I can’t remember if the very first versions of Visual Basic could do that, but Delphi definitely can and a lot has been improved since 1995.
I can’t remember any cases I had to look at its DFM markup, except maybe for diffing a few times, and that wasn’t...Read moreHoly cow, it’s just impossible to add a comment to appropriate branch of discussion from smartphone without some magic and accidentally unintentionally deleting one’s own previous comments.

I can’t remember any cases I had to look at its DFM markup, except maybe for diffing a few times, and that wasn’t for code review before committing but to find differences in setup of some really complicated grid control with hundreds of properties and quite weak documentation.
Well, in fact, I’d argue that for any application with UI of decent complexity bindings are worth using, better tools have also been invented and are used much more widely here, but anyway. Looks like a large part of the world decided to stay in Stone Age (not only C#) just to feel ”cool”, ”modern” and all that non-technical marketing-based stuff instead of actually doing the work.

That’s usually Me Gusta’s line! Binding is hard, regardless if you do it in XML or code though
