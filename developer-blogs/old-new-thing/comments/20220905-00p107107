I was about to say if taking TTD of different process at the same time (eg if interacting with each other), then the time travel positions are consistent between the two.
But in fact you already mention that
“This ordering is valid even across traces from different processes running simultaneously on the same system. (The consistent cross-process ordering is handy when you are debugging a problem that spans multiple processes.)”
