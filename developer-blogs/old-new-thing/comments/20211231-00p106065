I remember Watson from snooping in the Windows folder during the ME era. It’s kinda cute that Watson’s still being used for debugging purposes years later

Until I read to UWP start menu, I couldn’t imagine it’s something in Windows NT era.
There are some “memory cleaning” applications that uses `SetWorkingSet` to make the memory usage low, but terminating processes is so rude.

From time to time I find myself needing to run alternate shells (usually cmd.exe — I haven’t put forth the effort to actually make a low-impact GUI shell yet); this is getting really hampered because there’s no published way to launch UWP apps without explorer running, and with more and more stuff being moved from control panel to settings this is become more often needed.
But explorer is still a hog, and still needs half a GB RAM for itself (measured by paging impact with shell = cmd.exe vs shell = explorer.exe).

Right at this moment, in the computer I'm writing this on (running Windows 10 21H2 x64), I have five open Explorer windows (one on a folder with over a thousand files) and a single cmd.exe. Explorer is "wasting" 24,4 MB in the process that hosts the folder windows, and 52 MB in the desktop/taskbar/notifications process, while cmd.exe and conhost.exe are taking 7,1 MB. A 11:1 ratio, yes. But when you take into account that Explorer has five instances open, it's more like a 2:1 ratio. Not bad at all for a graphical vs. command line comparison, which is unfair in...Read moreRight at this moment, in the computer I’m writing this on (running Windows 10 21H2 x64), I have five open Explorer windows (one on a folder with over a thousand files) and a single cmd.exe.

And very far from the half a gigabyte you are spotting on your system. I’d recommend you to run SysInternals’ Autoruns and look for the shell extension(s) which are hogging memory.

For what it's worth, I recently did what Joshua did and observed the same result.  When explorer.exe is the default shell, many additional things are launched - SearchHost, StartMenuExperience, SmartScreen - and when I first did this I observed basically the same number, 500Mb of physical memory used.  The sum of the commits is substantially less.
Instead of explorer, I was using yui which provides a trivial start menu and task bar, so it's still graphical.
Unfortunately it's not terribly practical due to the amount of things explorer is involved in these days.  On Windows 11, doing this means...Read moreFor what it’s worth, I recently did what Joshua did and observed the same result.
