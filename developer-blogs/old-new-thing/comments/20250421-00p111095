PowerGridForecast looks really interesting, but I feel like it needs a way to override its data source. (Maybe it has one; I'll admit I haven't looked.)
My local energy provider claims a fairly low emissions rate of .0406 metric tons of CO₂ per MWh, so it probably doesn't make much difference, but I also have a decent amount of solar generating capacity which makes that number somewhat lower for me, especially on sunny days. It'd be nice if Windows had some way to talk to my solar combiner so it could know when I'm actively backfeeding power into the grid, as...Read morePowerGridForecast looks really interesting, but I feel like it needs a way to override its data source.

Of course that extra power use matters:
Every mW is sacred,
Every mW is great!
If a mW gets wasted,
Greta gets quite irate.
(Nothing against GT, I just needed a name to use).

I still don't understand why having seconds in the calendar view only was a problem. In Windows 10 you could just click on the date to open the calendar view and it shows seconds there for as long as you need, then when you click away it hides again. That sounds like a very optimal situation for reducing power usage. So why was that removed in Windows 11? And why now are some people getting Windows 10 builds that remove it from Windows 10 as well? This forces people to either turn it on all the time or to keep...Read moreI still don’t understand why having seconds in the calendar view only was a problem.

Control Panel still has a built-in clock that updates the seconds in real-time.  You can find it via (right-click the taskbar clock; Adjust date and time / Adjust date/time; Add clocks for different time zones / Additional clocks; Date and time tab).

Exactly. Forced regression as if Google or Apple people were running Microsoft and humiliating its customers.

I’m still wondering how energy consumption compares between Windows 8.1 start screen and Windows 10 v22H2 StartMenuExperienceHost.exe. The 8/8.1 animations are just so much more crisp than 10/11. Did 8/8.1 use more power to be crisp, or did 10/11 use more power than necessary and slowed down rendering?

Is nitpicker’s corner still a thing? Your first sentence should start “Over two decades ago…” as the linked post is from 2003.

What if we showed just the tens digit of the seconds?

@Raymond Chen:
Members of the energy efficiency team should have a stern talking to with Windows developers who keep adding dozens of new background services to Windows -- when did they last check how much resources and power those use? At least with seconds on taskbar if the users ask for it then it's justified, nobody asked for all those dumb services which just serve to increase the malware attack surface anyway yet most of them are on by default even if Microsoft's own security guidelines say they should be disabled and 90% of users don't need many of them for...Read more@Raymond Chen:

How about stop adding them?

Notice that the services consume 0% CPU when not in use. Some of them even shut themselves down when they haven’t been used for a while. Whereas seconds on the taskbar continues running all the time.

fair point – but where’s the careful cost/benefit analysis? So far I can’t see any improvements in Windows since Win 7 yet surely the amount of code included and presumably running is much larger in Win 8/10/11.  Again, to be fair this is really an empirical question, but I think the odds are quite good that Win11 uses more power at idle or even when being used.
Not to mention the much, much larger environmental cost of  the forced hardware discarded when Win10 goes EOL.

There are 63 instances of svchost.exe on my PC right now (and that's with many unnecessary services disabled mind you). For something that by your admission is doing nothing (and something consuming 0% CPU is doing nothing) they surely consume a lot of RAM (707 MB total) -- RAM which has to be powered on, clocked at high frequency, periodically refreshed so it doesn't lose contents (and much more often than once per second). And that's all without taking into account paging and the associated disk reads and writes, etc.

So by all means, please try to convince me that all those running services have no impact on power consumption while fretting over showing a second counter on taskbar.
In the meantime, read up on a “feature” called Recall which is getting added to Windows 11 and try to imagine how much power that will use once it starts screenshotting people’s desktops every 3 seconds and running ML on it then saving it in a local database. Let’s not even discuss the wear on the SSD writes, just the power impact of running that.
But yes, the seconds on taskbar are a problem. :rolleyes:
