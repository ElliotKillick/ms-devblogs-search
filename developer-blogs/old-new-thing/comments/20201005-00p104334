https://git-scm.com/docs/git-restore is new-ish (added in git 2.23) and will restore contents from an arbitrary source, while also removing files that didn’t exist in the source.
git restore --source= --staged --worktree --
https://git-scm.com/docs/git#_reset_restore_and_revert is also a good explanation of when to use restore vs other very similar commands

Hm, you are right, I didn’t really think about deleted or renamed files in my previous comment, as it happened to never have been an issue so far. Thanks for bringing this to my attention.

Off topic comment – but there is an interesting post today from Bruce Dawson over at RamdonASCII https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2020/10/04/windows-timer-resolution-the-great-rule-change/ that might make an interesting NewOldThing topic.
