Around the same time as this story, I had a digital camera that I used frequently at work, that required 4 AA batteries and drained them very quickly, so I always kept a large supply of them in my desk.  One day, I needed to take some pictures but I didn't have my camera.  I knew that the Maintenance Manager had the same model camera, so I borrowed his.
Halfway through taking pictures, the batteries were out of power, as usual, so I quickly dumped them out and replaced them.

Halfway through taking pictures, the batteries were out of power, as usual, so I quickly dumped them out and replaced them.  I finished taking the pictures I needed and returned the camera to the Maintenance Dept.
The next day, I got an angry phone call from the Maintenance Manager wanting to know what happened to the rechargeable batteries he had in his camera.
oops.

Rechargables being what they were back then, I doubt that they had many cycles left in them anyways (unless they had just been replaced.) I followed the directions on my recharger to the letter and still usually couldn’t get more than about 5 full charges on most of my batteries: given that they cost almost 6 times as much as regular batteries, I elected to not get any more.

This is more likely due to the chemistry of the battery than their condition. Ni-Mh and Ni-Cd batteries have a cell voltage of 1.2v rather than the 1.5v that normal disposable cells have. Most digital cameras of the time were designed to work with alkaline batteries and would assume the batteries were flat when they hit a certain voltage. Because of this (and the high drain cameras of that time put on the batteries) the camera would complain that the batteries were exhausted after only a few photos.
You still see artifacts of this today, non-rechargeable lithium batteries are still advertised...Read moreThis is more likely due to the chemistry of the battery than their condition.

You still see artifacts of this today, non-rechargeable lithium batteries are still advertised as being the best batteries for digital cameras (they have a cell voltage of 1.5v like an alkaline but have a much larger capacity) even though almost all cameras today use built in rechargeable lithium batteries.

I can’t remember ever getting this little use out of rechargeable batteries. Not even the really old NiCd batteries.
You can now buy NiMh AA batteries which can keep their charge for years. The easiest to recognize are the Eneloop branded ones, but other manufacturers make them as well — look for anything which says ready charged.

Rechargables… Once upon a time you need to fully discharge the batteries before you recharge them or it’ll harm the capacity of it.
Then now you should recharge your batteries before it goes below 20% (varies) or it’ll harm the capacity of it.
It made me puzzled on the years when both kind of batteries present on daily usage.

Apparently the administrative assistant taking care of that conference room was named Meridyth and not Pam.

And presumably immediately after taking the pictures they put the batteries back into their pagers?
