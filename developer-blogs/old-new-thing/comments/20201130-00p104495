It was a disappointment for me that the surface pro 3 had a fixed focus camera. We had a couple of hospitals acquire them early due to the great new form factor but then I couldn’t work out why they’d get such horrible photos of documents, patients and other things.
Fortunately the Pro 4 and onwards fixed this. Despite still occasionally seeing people in a crowd using their ipad as a camera, I’ve never seen someone do that with a surface… Wise users

It happens that I’m doing a mobile website that will use media API to “play” video on canvas object, then use a javascript library to read QR Code from it.
The performance is also largely depending on the auto-focus ability of the mobile phone camera, and higher-end models tend to do better.
