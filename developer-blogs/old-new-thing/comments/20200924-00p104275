Should Method1 in the interface projection:
struct ISomething : winrt::IInspectable
{
 void Method1(int32_t param1);
 winrt::hstring Method2();
};
 return a winrt::hresult (or something that), or should it really be void, as youâ€™ve written?

C++/WinRT represents HRESULT as an exception. If Method1 returns a failure HRESULT, it will be represented as an winrt::hresult_error (or derived) exception, in most cases.
void is correct.
