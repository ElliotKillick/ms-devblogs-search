I've always been curious about patterns in usages of the one-l canceled and two-l cancelled, as well as for other inflected forms (ending in -ing, -able, -er, and -ation) and for other verbs ending in -el (label, travel, level, model, etc.).
Some dictionaries describe the one-l forms as American and the two-l forms as British, but that hasn't been entirely consistent with what I've observed in practice.  I'm not even consistent myself, I've used both forms with some regularity.  As one more data point, Apple uses the two-l spelling cancelled as the instance property name in the NSOperation class.

The general reason is that the word "canceled" with one L (along with traveled, leveled, etc.) was promoted by Webster's Dictionary -- an American publication -- in the 19th century.  The "two L" variant is the original and is still the spelling used by people outside the United States.
This desire to shorten certain words was pretty arbitrary. "Spelled", for instance, still has two Ls.
Funny how history goes..... some guy named Noah had a bee in his bonnet about how some words are too long.  Two hundred years later, this creates frustration for defining APIs because you...Read moreThe general reason is that the word “canceled” with one L (along with traveled, leveled, etc.) was promoted by Webster’s Dictionary — an American publication — in the 19th century.

Hooray, something other than arcane C++ metaprogramming nonsense. I can actually understand what’s going on now! (Sorry. I’m just not a C++ person…)
