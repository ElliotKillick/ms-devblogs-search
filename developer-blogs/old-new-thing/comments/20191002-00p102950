It’s obvious once you point it out, but boy that’d be a headscratcher (at least for me) if I encountered it in the wild.  The standard pattern for lazy initialization is easy enough, but when the environment puts a couple of layers of indirection into the creation and storage of that first-time initialized value, important parts (like actually saving the value!) can be forgotten.

I don’t even know that I’d ever see something like this in the wild…I’d usually have flagged so much else in code review (I don’t even like setting DependencyProperties with codebehind, my DPs would be Color or Brush anyway, etc) that by the time those got addressed, the example here would ideally go way.  The first couple of times I read this, I kept saying “Wait, he’s trying to do *what* now?!??”
