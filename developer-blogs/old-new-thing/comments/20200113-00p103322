Ever thought of going into advertising?

For some reason, the WindowsApps folder is the first location that I immediately think of when reading the first half of article.

>”%PROGRAMFILES%\WindowsApps directory is non-enumerable to prevent users from browsing into it with Explorer and trying to double-click the programs in it. ”
I guess I must be doing it wrong
I pasted “%PROGRAMFILES%\WindowsApps” into explorer and had no problem.  I was able to go into that directory, view everything and and I even deleted a few files, just to see if I could (I immediately restored them from the recycle bin)

The statement is slightly inaccurate, to be completely accurate it should be:
> “%PROGRAMFILES%\WindowsApps directory is non-enumerable by standard users”
Administrators can enumerate the directory, this means that if you open up a command prompt running as an administrator, navigate to this directory and use the dir command, it will list the contents of the directory.
I’m not sure how Explorer acts when you disable UAC too. Windows 10 uses a split token, but it will automatically link the admin token to the restricted token meaning that it can always elevate without going through the UAC prompting.

Most probably you did wrong before: whenever you (try) to browse a non-enumerable directory like %PROGRAMFILES%\WindowsApps or %SYSTEMROOT%\Temp with File Explorer in a standard installation of Windows, i.e. under the qUACkery-controlled user account created during setup, you will be asked whether File Explorer should grant your user account permanent full access to this directory. See https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/950934/when-you-click-continue-for-folder-access-in-windows-explorer-your-use for this brain-dead behaviour.

On Windows 10 version 1909, %PROGRAMFILES%\WindowsApps has a fancy conditional ACE: (XA;;0x1200a9;;;BU;(Exists WIN://SYSAPPID))
The PowerShell command also shows several packages under C:\Windows\SystemApps, which is enumerable by BUILTIN\Users without conditions.

Interestingly (or not) you can view the WindowsApps directory in a store application such as Paint.NET and go to the file dialog. This is because Desktop Bridge (and sandboxed UWP) applications have the WIN://SYSAPPID security attribute set which allows you to enumerate that directory. It’d be most obvious in the legacy File Manager that MS released, however I can’t seem to find a way of navigating to a hidden directory.
