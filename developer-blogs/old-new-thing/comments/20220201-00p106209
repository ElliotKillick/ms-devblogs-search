So what happened in Windows 95 when you pressed Ctrl+Alt+Del?

I really want to say “Task Manager appears”, but there’s a hint of doubt in the back of my mind on that after saying it.

You’re right. Although it wasn’t really task manager because task manager didn’t exist.
It was a little dialogue box that was basically like task manager lite. It showed you what top level processes were running, and let you select one to end the task.
After a fresh boot the dialogue box was usually empty because it did not show background processes. Not that there were very many background processes on Windows 95 anyway.

So… I actually have an interesting story related to Mark’s NotMyFault utility. I tried it a few months ago on a Windows 11 computer and after the computer restarted from the BSOD (or technically GSOD because that computer was running a Dev Build) the computer kept crashing and going into automatic repair… The issue was fixed after I disabled and reenabled secure boot, though! So I’m guessing Windows 11 doesn’t like having a driver that was just added being ripped away from under its feet.

Based on Raymond’s description of the utility effectively hotpatching the kernel where the color values are stored, most likely the code was changed enough in Windows 11 that it was no longer modifying the color values but instead changed more critical values in the crash handler, causing the crash handler to crash as well.

You can make it green through registry, if you want. And it is always black for bugcheck 0x1C8 – https://twitter.com/0gtweet/status/1263381932500541441

Yes, I remember switching my bluescreen to white-text-on-red in Windows 3.1… don’t remember the actual INI setting though. I was really sad to find out that this option didn’t carry over to Windows 95, as that crashed much more often on my system (at least in the early versions) than Windows 3.1 did…..
