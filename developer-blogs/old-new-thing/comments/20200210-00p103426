What I don’t understand is why the whole Windows update process is so painfully slow (especially if you’re running Server 2016, where the monthly updates take several hours to apply – assuming the update even succeeds, which it often doesn’t). I can usually patch my Gentoo box (which compiles everything on-the-fly, and updates every program installed on the system) faster than Windows updates just itself.

I've been wondering this for a while and hope you touch on this in this series:
Let's say MS releases patch 1 for File A, then patch 2 for File A.
If a user applies patch 2, is patch 1 automatically installed since they have the latest version of File A? Or does MS maintain two separate versions (until the next Service Pack or Cumulative Update) allowing the customer to opt out of patch 1 in the short term?
Now what if let's say MS releases a patch 3 for Files A and B. Then later a patch 4 for files B and...Read moreI’ve been wondering this for a while and hope you touch on this in this series:

Now what if let’s say MS releases a patch 3 for Files A and B. Then later a patch 4 for files B and C.
A user installs patch 4 but not patch 3. What happens here?
If File B has code for patches 3 and 4, file A would need patch 3 code as well to avoid incompatibility problems. Would it be included in patch 4? Or would patch 4 block the install of patch 3 (never seen this happen so I assume this isn’t it)?
Or would patches of this type simply not be allowed outside of a major OS or service pack (or whatever it’s called now) update?

My understanding is that all patches are cumulative, so each patch includes all earlier patches. (There was a time where piecemeal patches were supported, and it was a nightmare getting all the dependencies right, not to mention exponentially exploding the number of configurations.)

I seem to recall Xbox updates that were significantly larger than 1GB. I think they were 2GB or even 4GB.

Would Xboxes even reuse any Windows Update code? Xboxes are far more locked down than PCs so there are probably easier approaches to take. For example,  it is impossible for an Xbox user to follow Raymond’s example and install a hotfix outside of the normal patching cycle.
