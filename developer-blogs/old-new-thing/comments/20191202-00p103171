I believe that the dilemma with lazy marshalling is not only that it’s somewhat less efficient to capture the necessary info by switching context, but also that this may happen at time when the caller is more time constrained. On the other hand, if you create the agile references in a tight loop, you may wish to pass the burden of preparing proxy info to another thread, even if it’s likely you will have to pay this cost later, with interest.

I am sorry to be totally off-topic, but how can I report a bug to Microsoft? What I am seeing is that the clipping region of the HDC given by WM_ERASEBKGND/WM_PAINT sometimes does not exclude the child controls, even though the parent has the WS_CLIPCHILDREN style. This happens only when the parent is a child control itself.
I like your blog a lot. Thanks for doing this and I am sorry for my intrusion again.
