I guess the other way is to invoke the tasks and then subsequently await them. I don’t know C++ very well so excuse me for my pseudocode:
auto tasks[] = { GetHighScoreAsync(), GetNameAsync(), GetPictureAsync() };
// Get information in parallel. Faster!
for (task: tasks) try { co_await task; } catch (...) {}
P.S. You have a call to GetPictureAsyncAsync()…

That should work, but only for eager-starting coroutines; I forget whether C++ is eager or lazy.

Looks like C++ can do both: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20210421-00/?p=105135
