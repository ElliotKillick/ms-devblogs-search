> What is going on is that if you ask for the 64-bit file identifier from a ReFS system, it will take the 128-bit identifier and see if the upper 64 bits are all zero. If so, then it gives you the lower 64 bits.
No, as far as I know, ReFS does not work such. The upper 64 bits are always non-zero. Then, the 64-bit value that combines the upper 64 bits and the lower 64 bits is returned.
