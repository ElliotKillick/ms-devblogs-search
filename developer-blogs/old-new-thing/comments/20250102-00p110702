Interesting note about the “wait reasonable amount of time, then force-close”. I wonder how many places throughout Windows have these little clock-time traps that can cause corruption if they expire.
In theory, I always tend to believe “well, even if this old device is painfully slow, it should complete all it’s tasks eventually” but I guess that’s not actually the case – explains why it always feels like things are actually less stable running on slow hardware.
