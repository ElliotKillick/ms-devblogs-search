Not going to lie, when people talk about implementing things that require security in user space I just chuckle. While finding specific items in your own user space may not be the most trivial thing to do in all cases... insofar as the memory is mapped and in your security level, and marked for read, it can be read. Now... if a driver used user space memory for things and mapped that into all graphical processes that could be a bigger issue (IIRC this has happened but not exactly as described, more drivers not sanitizing GPU memory before giving it...Read moreNot going to lie, when people talk about implementing things that require security in user space I just chuckle.
