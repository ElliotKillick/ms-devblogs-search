KB article 320246 also explains how you can end up with mismatched inherited permissions. Annoyingly the UI will only recalculate the inheritance when you make an irrelevant change to the ACL, so it takes two steps to correct the inherited permissions.

Perhaps there should be flags to change this behavior? E.g. RegSetKeySecurity could take a PROPAGATE_SECURITY flag and SetSecurityInfo could take a NO_PROPAGATE_SECURITY flag (if it doesn’t already)?

Although I guess that would contribute to the impression of Win32 as a “flag-happy” API.
