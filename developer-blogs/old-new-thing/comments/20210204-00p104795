A problem with a function like unbox_value_or is that it eagerly evaluates the second argument and then discards it if the first argument is valid.  If the target type is not trivial, I would use a plain if instead.

Agreed. In other languages (the ones I can actually code in), my equiv of this would use a lambda as the default param so the default wasn’t constructed unless necessary (no good if the default you want to pass back really is a lambda of course…)

wouldn’t the second one try to cast param to Thing?
