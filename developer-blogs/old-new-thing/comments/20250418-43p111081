Doesn’t the initialization have to somehow be reset as well?
Also, that lambda doesn’t seem to return anything, so would that even compile? (the initialization of `init`)

“on which [some Widget] it [WidgetRouter] dutifully calls Close”, not quite. The WidgetRouter is simply releasing an object (IUnknown::Release). That a Widget chooses to Close itself when the reference count reaches zero, is dutifully done by the Widget.
