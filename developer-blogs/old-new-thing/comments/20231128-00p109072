The “three versions of WinSCP” story reminds me of the early days of Apple App Store, when there were a good number of blank paid apps with fancy and attractive names but no content.

I can imagine Microsoft gets a lot of those beg bounties every day

Personal opinion here.
This post exposes another problems of the Windows Store and Winget, sharing issues with Android and Apple store:
You don't know what you get. You don't know what winget will download an install. There is not much control in the Microsoft Store, and to real way to actually verify what you get is legit. "Publisher name" does not count here, and many official apps have weird publisher names. I see more sketchy apps than normal apps, so the trust is not there.

I see more sketchy apps than normal apps, so the trust is not there. Only when a program gives a direct link to the Microsoft store to the exact product id and I have no other way, then I use the Microsoft Store.
This is the main reason what I am not using the powershell gallery the “nuget” way: I rather download the package manually and unpack-install it manually. You can call this a “Zero Trust”, if you will, but the store contents are not taken care enough for trust, whereas the powershell gallery is open enough for manual checking.

This doesn’t really say much for the MS Store vetting process! Lets just hope these paid-for versions of other people’s free software are only being used to profit off someone else’s work, and haven’t been modified to add spy/malware.

The pedantic classification is that WinSCP is free freeware (first free for freedom, second free- for price of zero). I think it’s also worth mentioning that `winget install WinSCP` does not install any of the three versions from Store but another version. It’s like “restaurant A offers a cup of water for $1 while coffee-shop B offers it for free, and the latter is a vulnerability of the former”.

I expect the “My product was mentioned in a TONT article” sticker shortly 🙂  Even better that it wasn’t all or part of an actual problem!

“It’s not clear how it’s the fault of Windows that a rogue employee can use WinSCP to disclose confidential information.”
I don’t know why you bother to ask O:) . For certain kind of people, it’s always Windows’ fault. The printer is out of ink? Windows’ fault! The monitor breaks? Windows’ fault! My car fails to start? Windows’ fault! Blaming the usual suspect is easier than learning how things actually work.

The “breathless prose” wouldn’t have been AI-generated would it?
