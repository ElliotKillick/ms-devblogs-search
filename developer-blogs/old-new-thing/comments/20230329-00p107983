I think a ternary works quite nicely here and would make it easier for the compiler to optimize out a branch:

    case WM_GETDLGCODE:
        auto msg = (MSG*)lParam; 
        // When the user presses Enter on a closed combo box
        // say that we want the message, in addition to whatever
        // else the combo box wants to say.
        LRESULT extra_flags = msg &&
            msg->message == WM_KEYDOWN &&
            msg->wParam == VK_RETURN) ? DLGC_WANTMESSAGE : 0;
        return extra_flags | DefSubclassProc(hwnd, message, wParam, lParam);
        break;

That code is much less readable, and there are no additional optimizations performed if you actually bothered to check what the compiler does.
