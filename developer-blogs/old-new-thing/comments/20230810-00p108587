16 byte block is insanity. I had no idea MSVC deque is so wildly inefficient.
How is the block size enter into the ABI? seems like just an implementation detail.. Itâ€™s not like the layout of the class changes in any way if a different block size is chose.

If two components disagree on the block size, then one component will allocate (say) 16 bytes for a block, and the other component will read 32 bytes from the block.
