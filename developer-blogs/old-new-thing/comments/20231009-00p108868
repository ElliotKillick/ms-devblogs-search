The Linux kernel has a feature, "transparent huge pages", which is not always a benefit for the reasons you outline. The one thing it has that Windows (as yet) does not is a way for the application to hint that a region would benefit from huge pages if the OS believes that huge pages would be valuable.
Note that because "madvise(start, length, MADV_HUGEPAGE)" is merely a hint, the OS is free to ignore it and use small pages instead - e.g. to make the region pageable. It's just the application telling the OS that it's going to access most of that...Read moreThe Linux kernel has a feature, “transparent huge pages”, which is not always a benefit for the reasons you outline.

The only thing close to this is that Windows kernel will attempt to use 1 GB page for every 512 multiple of 2 MB ones.
