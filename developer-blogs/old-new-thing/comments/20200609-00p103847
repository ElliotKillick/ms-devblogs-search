I am surprised that the Itanium is still a thing in 2020 (although to be fair its probably only still a thing because HP is spending $$$ to make it still a thing so they can compete with the likes of SPARC and POWER)

I’ve glanced back across your Itanium processor series and i’m still not 100% sure, but presumably an overflow of the register backing store would also be caught by SEH? Could you do something like count how nested you can get into a recursive function?
I suppose the difficulty would be in knowing how much spill-space your function requires, maybe some inline assembly that forces (all/as many registers as possible) to be banked. Though I’m not quite sure how that’d interact with Itanium’s complicated register schedule.

I have a bad feeling that I’m the one who wrote and named _resetstkoflw, about 20 years ago.  Sorry, I have no excuse for the name.  It was a simpler time, when vowels were too valuable to waste, I guess.

When I was a mainframe programmer, I always wondered why IBM System/360 and 370 JCL had an “ASSGN” keyword to … assign things.  The keyword saved ONE letter.  The limit for these kinds of keywords was 8 characters… ASSIGN is only 6 characters.
Apparently vowels cost much more than consonants back in the good old days.

Now that the Great Vowel Shortage is over, we’re getting ridiculus identifiers like hardware_constructive_interference_size in C++.

Meh, vowels kshmowels (says someone whose surname has a cluster of Slavic consonants).
At first I wondered if it had to do with some old compiler or linker limit on the number of characters considered in an exported identifier, but that wouldn’t make sense since the first (eg) 6 chars are “resets” or “_reset” if the underscore counts, which isn’t exactly a unique-ish name.

Scarcity of vowels has been an ongoing problem with computers for decades: I blame programmers who never empty their bit buckets.

The code example seems to be missing “if {” before “GetExceptionCode()”.

Nope, it’s good. The expression inside the __except is supposed to return a code that tells the structured exception handler what to do next. If the exception was a stack overflow, we want to run the handler. Otherwise, we want to propagate it.
