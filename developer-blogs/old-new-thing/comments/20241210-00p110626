So an antivirus wants to scan my computer and delete whatever it wants. That’s great except… do you have a warrant?  No?  Turn around and help yourself out sir.

A better front door analogy might be relating to having a glass window in the door: “If the bad guy punches out the window, they can reach in and unlock the door rather than climb thought the broken glass”. Putting a keyed lock-turn on the inside might make it a little harder to get in, but a bad guy who is able and willing to punch out the window is going to get in one way or the other.

Perhaps it’s even a better analogy than you realize, as people still insist an interior keyed lock-turn is safer, despite the ample evidence to the contrary.
