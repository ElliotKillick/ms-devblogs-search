Since we have “deducing this” now, can we rewrite the async lambda to capture by value and also take this by value?

Yes, but so far I don’t think any compilers support that yet. It is a good way to allow lambdas to be coroutines though.

“And instead of passing the other lambda parameters by reference, we can use a reference capture. We just have to be careful to copy them to locals before our first co_await.”
That strikes me as an argument in favor of explicit captures:
auto task = [&maker, &current, &suspend]() -> Async { /* same */ }();
