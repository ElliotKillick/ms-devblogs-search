When a cursor is loaded with LR_DEFAULTSIZE the cursor can dynamically switch resolution when moved from a lo-dpi to hi-dpi monitor.  (eg: create a cursor with multiple resolutions (eg 32x32 and 64x64) with different markings on each resolution and move it between hi and lo dpi monitors and you'll see the cursor change).
How does that work? And how does it fit in to this topic of working out the icon size? (since GetIconInfo returns the same info regardless of which monitor the cursor is on).  What's the secret magic going on under there covers here?  I'm yet...Read moreWhen a cursor is loaded with LR_DEFAULTSIZE the cursor can dynamically switch resolution when moved from a lo-dpi to hi-dpi monitor.

I wanted to turn the default I-beam cursor back into a .CUR file to be sure that it was the transparency that was somehow confusing Remote Desktop rather than anything else (see my comment on the previous post but one). It turned out to be harder than I anticipated; I ended up hardcoding most of the file, and just copying the bitmap bits from the monochrome bitmap returned from , although upside-down of course. Strictly speaking, this isn't necessarily the default cursor, since it's only one size, but it sufficed for the purpose.

“² Even though the name of the function says that it gets icon info, the documentation notes that it also works for cursors.”
Fun Fact of the Day: IIRC this is because icons and cursors* are pretty much exactly the same internally, except cursors have a hotspot (the precise pixel where actual mouse interactions happen) and icons don’t. I think the file formats might even be the same. It’s been a while though.
* – Static CUR cursors, not animated ANI ones.

The on-disk formats are the same size but not the same, cursors don’t support planes nor fast BPP lookups because that is where the hotspot is stored. The resource formats have more differences and cursors can in theory be larger than 256×256 pixels.

In the beginning (up to Windows 3.11), cursors were limited to 32×32 pixels and 1 bit per pixel (plus anther one for transparency), just the same as a monochrome icon. At that time, the only difference between a monochrome icon and a cursor was the hotspot. Otherwise, the file formats were exactly the same. I remember being able to use a standard icon editor for creating custom cursors back in the day. Of course, the only limitation was the hotspot which should be at the top left corner, because an icon editor can’t set it.

Actually monochrome cursors support 4 values, black, white, transparent and inverse. Windows 95-2000 also supported colour XOR masks, although normally cursor editors only allowed black and white (which map to transparent and inverse). You could use colour XOR masks to create interesting effects, of which my favourite was an XOR mask of grey (0x808080) to create a semi-inverse effect which worked on any background (the default inverse effect doesn’t work very well on a grey background). Sadly that effect stopped working in Windows XP.

Black, white, transparent and inverse. Four values. Two bits per pixel in two planes, equivalent to two monochrome (1 bpp) bitmaps. Just what I said. What I called the “image” is, technically, the XOR mask, and what I called the “transparency”, is the AND mask.

NOTE : This doesn’t work if you resize the mouse cursor by using “Change mouse pointer size” in Settings.  The bitmap size of the cursor will still be 32.
