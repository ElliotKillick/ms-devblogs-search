Could you (ab)use the CopyRect function to copy any 8 bytes around or would it fail on some memory contents? Do you know if programmers and compilers used that trick?
Looking through the related functions https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/gdi/rectangle-functions , I can see all sorts of potentially abusable ones, for programmers or compilers wanting to save space and willing to make a function call with far pointers. ðŸ™‚

As Neil Rashbrook pointed out in the original post, another advantage to using these Windows-provided functions meant not having to include the CRT with your program.  Not only did that translate to a smaller in-memory footprint, but it also meant smaller on-disk footprints and simplified code distribution.  In a time when programs were carried around on floppy disk and downloaded from dial-up services, being able to provide a single zero-install .EXE for a handy application was a big win.

256MB? Who has 256MB on an 8086?

Oops. Fixed, thanks.

Yeah, Iâ€™m pretty sure thatâ€™s supposed to be 256KB (like in the initial article from February).
But, whatâ€™s three orders of magnitude among friends?
Iâ€™m, uh, glad I donâ€™t need to count every byte like this in my day job. Itâ€™s amazing what old games and programs did in just a few dozen kilobytes.

Sometimes you wish people would go back at least a few steps to those times. Now you have custom script code interpreted by python interpreter writeen in typescript dynamically transpiled into javascript running in a web browser written in java emulated in .net written in javascript on a nodejs server running in an docker image on a linux VM running on a hypervisor written in java in an antivirus sandboxâ€¦ because we have so many resources, so who cares
and all the program does is display a cat picture with a whole bunch on ads plastered around

Typo? He probably meant 256KB. I assume that muscle memory kicked in and type MB.
