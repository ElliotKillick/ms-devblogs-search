While dumpbin is useful, I find having `nm` (like llvm-nm on Windows) more practical. As long as you not working with LTCG symbols, it’ll read most (if not all of it).

please Support ASPX page on .netcore.
how many people are using razor-page?it is a html.
i know very more persons are using ASPX-page. i don’t known why netcore not support aspx?
design for using,not for designing.
设计是为了用的，不是为了设计而设计的，更不是为了显得自己高明而设计的。

Dependency Walker is just as valuable as dumpbin if not more so, when  investigating unresolved external symbols across dynamic libraries, yet there is nothing on the Windows SDK as alternative, and the old version hardly works on modern Windows versions.

While that kind of tool is useful for working out problems with runtime dependencies, the post itself isn’t about that.
If you look at the sample commands, they end in a .lib extension. So this is about link time issues, dealing with LNK2001 and LNK2019.

I’m not sure what/if anything is missing wrt Dependency Walker, but this tool is a great alternative: https://github.com/lucasg/Dependencies
