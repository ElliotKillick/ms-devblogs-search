You could also treat the array as a ring buffer, so spares at the opposite end could be used without moving the elements. This has a slight wrinkle that you cannot use up the last spare because that would make first == last, making the container indistinguishable from empty. The other O(n) reallocation issue still applies though.

You can solve the first == last problem by recording the range as (first, size).
