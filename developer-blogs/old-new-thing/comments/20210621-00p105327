"Remember that the s# and d# registers overlap, so if you use s0 and then need a double-precision register, you have to move up to d1."
Even through the FPU hasn't been covered, its register model has been seen in the first part of the series, published three weeks ago. In it, Raymond states that the single and double precision registers overlap: s0 and s1 share space with d0, s2 and s3 with d1, and so on. So, if you are using s0, the first half of d0 is already in use, and the first fully available double precision register is...Read more“Remember that the s# and d# registers overlap, so if you use s0 and then need a double-precision register, you have to move up to d1.”

So, if you are using s0, the first half of d0 is already in use, and the first fully available double precision register is d1. That leaves s1 (the second half of d0) free, which explains the backfill.
It is a bit strange if you have in mind the 80×87 register model, where each register can hold either a single, double or extended precision value, simply leaving the unused bits alone. But, hey, this is a RISC processor, so you have to assume things work differently. And these things aren’t unseen even on CISC processors: the 8080/Z80 can operate pairs of 8-bit registers as 16-bit registers, and even the 8086/88 can pair two 16-bit registers to contain 32-bit results and operands in the MUL and DIV instructions.

Well, in fact, x87 registers are 80 bits wide and always hold Extended values, and fld/fild instructions perform appropriate conversion while loading if necessary (fst/fstp/fist/fistp converting back if necessary). But yes, the RISCy way is quite different.

MIPS R400 and SuperH-3 did the same thing, per Raymond’s previous series on those processors.
