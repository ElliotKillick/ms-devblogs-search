Bonus chatter: std::unique_ptr does not, and will never have deduction guides; that is,

Foo *foo = bar();
// this will never compile, even in C++77
std::unique_ptr baz(foo);
will never be well-formed. This is because baz could equally reasonably be std::unique_ptr<Foo> or std::unique_ptr<Foo[]>. (Unless C++77 gets, say, unification-based type inference…)
