Reading this article again a week later feels a bit different, having just spent a day and a half trying to help identify and patch all the products and systems our company uses that are affected by the newly announced log4j exploit nicknamed “Log4Shell”.
Not that that exploit has anything to do with incorrect field lengths. But it serves as a reminder that even a generic logging function can be a huge security risk.

Surely this also leaves you at the mercy of merely buggy drivers as well though, does it not? If an attacker can find a buggy driver that triggers this behaviour, they can then look for systems with that driver installed and attempt to exploit it. And given what you've posted previously about driver shenanigans I'm sure there are a lot of buggy drivers out there, so it wouldn't surprise me if at least one is passing incorrect field lengths to LogXyz. There might not technically be a security boundary in between the driver and the data, but that doesn't mean...Read moreSurely this also leaves you at the mercy of merely buggy drivers as well though, does it not? If an attacker can find a buggy driver that triggers this behaviour, they can then look for systems with that driver installed and attempt to exploit it. And given what you’ve posted previously about driver shenanigans I’m sure there are a lot of buggy drivers out there, so it wouldn’t surprise me if at least one is passing incorrect field lengths to LogXyz. There might not technically be a security boundary in between the driver and the data, but that doesn’t mean it’s not a security risk. (As are all drivers, which is why we’re pretty much doomed.)
The other consideration, I suppose, is where the logged infomation goes. Presumably it will, in the end, be accessible to user mode (I’m guessing the kernel isn’t that interested in inspecting logs). So is the leaked information crossing a security boundary in that direction? (Genuine question, I am not a programmer of any sort and only have a fuzzy picture of the security model.)

Yes, it would still be a good thing for LogXyz to validate the offsets, as a defense in depth.
