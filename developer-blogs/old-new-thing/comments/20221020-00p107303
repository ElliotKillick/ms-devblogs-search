When an application crashes (e.g. due to an AV) there is usually a box that says something like “close program, debug the program, or send errors to Microsoft”. Is this implemented inside the unhandled exception filter (e.g. sending RPC to some other process that displays the dialog) or some other part of the OS? What if you fiddle with the internal SEH data structures and get rid of the unhandled exception filter? Does the faulting process then just terminate without showing that dialog?
