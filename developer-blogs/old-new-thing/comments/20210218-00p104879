For future developers that get here searching for a way to block CSS/images/etc.:
Keep in mind that external resources can generally also be embedded inside the HTML document that references them (using inline styles, data-URIs, etc.). While the methodology shown in this blog post prevents external resources from being fetched, it does not prevent these technologies from being used by the loaded web-page.
If all you are after is a semi-offline-mode (like the customer presumably was), then the presented solution is a good option.
