And that explains why I can never prove that the built-in anti-virus/anti-malware is the thing killing the system performance.  I knew that disabling Windows Defender would cause my build time to drop from 86 seconds to 3.9 seconds (95% improvement), but i could never figure out how to prove it in WPR/WPA. It was important because if i could solve this fairly trivial case using WPA, then how could i possibly solve problems in the wild?
tl;dr: Always disable any anti-virus that synchronously intercepts your I/O operations.
Bonus: Disable any anti-virus system that will intercept a read, return 0x800700E1 (ERROR_VIRUS_INFECTED)...Read moreAnd that explains why I can never prove that the built-in anti-virus/anti-malware is the thing killing the system performance.

You easily can see what the virus scanner overhead is. It is just not the Disk IO or File IO Graph in WPA. You need to enable Context Switch Tracing and probably CPU Sampling (1kHz) to see where your application did wait for a Write/Read/CreateFile and CloseHandle call. The readying thread will tell you if the disk driver or the virus scanner did unblock your thread.
If you want to get more sophisticated use Stacktags and. See e.g. https://github.com/Alois-xx/etwcontroller/blob/master/ETWController/ETW/VirusScanners.stacktags for an example for TrendMicro.
