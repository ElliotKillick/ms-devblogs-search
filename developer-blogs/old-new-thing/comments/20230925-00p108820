Is there a way to post custom coalesceable windows message, like WM_TIMER and WM_PAINT?
The motivation is basically the same as WM_PAINT, "Combining WM_PAINT messages reduces the number of times a window must redraw the contents of its client area.", but with custom tasks.
An imperfect solution is to use MsgWaitForMultipleObjects and SetEvent. But this method is hampered by many internal modal message loops which the application has no control over.
For example, MsgWaitForMultipleObjects has no chance to run when a window/scrollbar is being dragged or a menu is opened, causing the custom task processing to halt.
