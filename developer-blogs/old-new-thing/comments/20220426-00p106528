Years++ ago I was tasked with making a unix version of one of our (at the time) "server" programs. The unix "client" and x-platform glue was already written. Part of the NT version was chosen to be written as a kernel device driver to meet realtime requirements... Anyway..., The client was willing to pay all the $$$ for the new driver. My initial solution was to put a windows box in a cardboard box with a power cord coming out and a bold note about it in the user manual and call it done. I even demoed the working system...Read moreYears++ ago I was tasked with making a unix version of one of our (at the time) “server” programs.

I got in trouble as an IBM intern for wearing shorts in the office (1988 or 89)

“security violation” basically means “because I said so”

I really enjoyed this perspective and would have loved the idea of a confidential coffee maker (or any coffee maker...) back then!  I was one of those IBM software engineers who was drinking the 'coffee' from those paper cups in the early 80s while OS/2 was under development. I wasn't involved in OS/2 but was a software engineer working on CAD/CIM 'program products' at the time.
For another perspective on culture, the timing of my career as a software engineer subjected me to 'mandatory antitrust training' twice.

For another perspective on culture, the timing of my career as a software engineer subjected me to ‘mandatory antitrust training’ twice.  Once when I was still an IBM employee, when we were required to take antitrust training to understand that it was anti-competitive to bundle software and hardware.  I learned quite a lot about product pricing and finance during that training at IBM.  My second ‘mandatory antitrust training’ came many years later when I joined Microsoft.  That training required me to listen to someone tell me that it was not appropriate to use phrases like ‘crush the competition’, which to me was just good professional common sense.  Maybe what that Microsoft training really taught me was just how far we’d come, culturally, in the profession, and that maybe wearing ties and having more women in the industry was not so bad after all…
We really did have quite a lot of fun in software engineering at IBM during the early 80s.  It was an amazing place that produced amazing products, but oh, those coffee machines were really terrible!

Is this just correlation in the quote above, or what does wearing ties have to do with women in the industry??
The former not something I would ever miss, and the latter a real shame. 🙂

Of course, this reminds me of the MS OS/2 2.0 debacle.

Ironically, cardboard is flammable.
But the autoignition point of paper is much higher than the boiling point of water, and I can’t imagine a coffee maker getting hotter than that, so it was probably fine.

The next step is to declare the entire office Microsoft Confidential and avoid the consequences of leaving papers on desks, right?

I love so much about this story.
But mainly the irreverence all around.
