That said, in the unlikely case when the DLL in question is indeed a reasonably vanilla in-proc COM server but doesn't self-register, there are still things they can do about it. For one, take a look at the resources - does it have an embedded typelib? If so, pull the CLSIDs/ProgIDs from there, and slap the InprocServer32 with the DLL path on the former.
IIRC, the DllRegisterServer thing predates ActiveX on the Web, it was introduced along with in-proc servers in general when 16 bit COM/OLE 2 were first introduced, made popular by Word 6.

We had a slightly different problem although it seems to have abated now, but some years ago there was some widespread brain rot where people would automatically try and register any DLL they encountered.  We got so many problem reports from people trying to register a DLL that wasn’t a COM server that we added a dummy DllRegisterServer() that pops up an error message asking the user why they’re trying to register a DLL that isn’t supposed to be registered.
I wanted to add “Does your mother know you’re doing this?” to the message but was overruled.

The reason for this was due to a bug in Windows Update for Windows 7 and Windows 8. It would randomly lose DLL registrations of critical windows components causing explorer to break in mysterous ways.
The fix was to register *all* DLLs in Windows\system32 with regsvr32 using a cmd.exe for loop; ignoring any errors this generated. All you did by popping up the message box was annoy people trying to fix this.

And if you’re the DLL author and the dll does need registering, please make regsvr32 conoso.dll work. I’ve seen too many cases where some completely outside thing damaged the DLL registration and it needed to be redone and the setup program wouldn’t do it because the product was installed as far as it could see.

I’ve lost count of how many times I had to explain to bosses, managers and coworkers that there is nothing magical about registering a DLL, that it is just a call of a function.

Excellent info.
