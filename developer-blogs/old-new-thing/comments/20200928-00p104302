After using git for about 3 months I came to the conclusion it’s part version control system and part text-based puzzle game

I would probably attack this the other way around.
git checkout --detach
git reset --hard A
git reset --soft branch
git checkout branch
git commit -m "Bulk revert back to A"

That’s also my unsophisticated approach to similar problems so far but this series really showed me how useful the low-level write-tree commands and Co are.
Sure I’ve read the section in the git book about them, but never used them in practice, so it’s nice to see examples where they’re useful.
So great series Raymond, not just the specific problems but showing the usefulness of the non-standard commands!
