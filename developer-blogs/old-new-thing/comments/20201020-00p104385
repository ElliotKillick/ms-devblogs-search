The “GetVolumePathNameW function” page on Microsoft Docs looks damaged. Its examples are missing too.

I've tried to do this in .NET Framework before, and was surprised to find there seems to be no way to get the volume mount point for an arbitrary path, and DriveInfo only supports drive letters. I ended up wrapping some WinAPI calls with PInvoke.
I used GetVolumePathName, but then I jumped right to GetVolumeInformation rather than getting the actual volume name and opening a handle. I'll be interested in seeing what you're doing and what sort of information you can pull (what I got was enough for me IIRC).
I just checked .NET Core and it still seems to have...Read moreI’ve tried to do this in .NET Framework before, and was surprised to find there seems to be no way to get the volume mount point for an arbitrary path, and DriveInfo only supports drive letters.

I just checked .NET Core and it still seems to have that problem. The docs for DriveInfo still say it only accepts drive letters. Odd since I would think they would want to rework that given the opportunity since MacOS and Linux both primarily mount volumes in folders.

Are the Windows people still not using std::array in place of C-style arrays?

If you can come up with a single advantage in the given code of using std::array instead of a normal array I’m all ears.
Otherwise you simply make the code more complicated for no good reason. Most people would think this is not a good thing even if it allows you to play with a new toy.

you can call .size() on an array to get its size
I don’t think std::array is in any way more complicated than C-style arrays; it’s the converse in fact.  It has none of the surprising behaviors (decaying, not copy constructible/assignable) that C-style arrays have.  I think most people will agree volumePath.data(), volumePath.size() is more comprehensible than volumePath, ARRAYSIZE(volumePath) which involves both decaying and a non-standard macro.

I try to stick to C-friendly code, using C++ only where necessary (like for RAII), because it reduces confusion. Note also that .size() returns a size_t, so you’re going to have to do a volumePath.data(), static_cast<DWORD>(volumePath.size()), which is getting unwieldy.
