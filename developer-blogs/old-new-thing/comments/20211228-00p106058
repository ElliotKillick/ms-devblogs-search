That‚Äôs how multitasking cards worked in WebOS back in the late Palm/HP days (Palm Pre, Pixi, HP TouchPad).  You could flick cards up (same action you do in Android these days), or you could pull a card down and slingshot it off the screen.  So much more satisfying that way.

The thing is your fruit competitor does this exactly because it conveys useful information.
First, a gesture response tells you the system received your command and understood it. When the action is invalid, it acts like an error message. If you can't type in a screen, for example, Windows makes an error beep. That tells you to change something before trying again. What happens if you don't get a touchscreen gesture response? You assume the system was locked up or your screen was contaminated by water or your gloves aren't touchscreen compatible and try again, maybe multiple times. That's frustrating.

Second, changes in the gesture response tell you whether you can swipe left or right. A strong rubberband, where the object slips under your finger, tells you that you can‚Äôt do anything‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs the invalid action response. In contrast, accurate tracking of your finger indicates that you are going to trigger a response.
Look at Apple‚Äôs Mail app. Previously, you could only left-swipe to delete, they added right-swipe gestures later. Nothing was ‚Äúwasted‚Äù.

An important distinction is that when you swipe in a direction that is unintended on a fruit device, it doesn't do anything. Just moves with your finder then goes back to the original location.
I still think designers should treat gestures the same way as keyboard shortcuts. They're not immediately visible, and many users avoid them do to this fact. Just give me a button. I think it was a very bad idea to have the annoying little bounce animation on the lock screens of Windows 8 and iOS 5. Just do the action I'm telling you to do, not play...Read moreAn important distinction is that when you swipe in a direction that is unintended on a fruit device, it doesn‚Äôt do anything.

Touchscreen input is inherently more difficult than keyboard shortcuts. It‚Äôs hard to mess up keyboard input, where as gestures require recognition algorithms and therefore are inherently fuzzy. On top, you have issues like palm inputs, parallax, finger width, water on screen, gloves, etc. That‚Äôs why feedback is important.
Other thing to note is that it‚Äôs hard enough that most of the industry gave up trying to get gestures to work right and shoved Android into everything (e.g. kiosks, printers, desk phones, car infotainment).

I disagree with the ‚Äúyou won‚Äôt be able to add swipe-left features in the future‚Äù as that is clearly a completely different gesture than pulling a toast to the left, keeping contact with it while moving it and then letting it go, which more reminds me of how you catapult birds in Angry Birds. üôÇ Some similar sound effects as the invisible rubber band is stretched and a nice woosh sound as you shoot it off, maybe a small explosion a little bit later, and call it Angry Toasts. Missed opportunity!

The boundary between "Swipe left" and "Stretch and fling" is not sharp. For example, you start to swipe left, dwell for a half-second to reconsider, and the decide "Yes, I really want to delete this" and let go. Oops, that half-second dwell converted your swipe into a stretch.  Or you're a user with reduced mobility (e.g., over age 70) so anything that is based on speed or coordination becomes difficult to execute. "Okay, dad, now move it to the left and quickly let go. No, you can't stop your finger before you move it. You have to let go...Read moreThe boundary between ‚ÄúSwipe left‚Äù and ‚ÄúStretch and fling‚Äù is not sharp.

My mum (75) struggles immensely with touch screens,  sadly very few phones left with a real keyboard that is usable for someone like her,  tiny keys aren‚Äôt much help either.

It‚Äôs kind of comments that I find are the biggest ‚Äògolden nuggets‚Äô this site delivers and why I‚Äôve been reading it (dutifully) for years.
They show just how much though has gone into the design and usability (and rejection) of a feature, what edge cases have been considered and how it should/would work.
If wish for this kind of detail to be more available in all aspects of application development (msdn, documentation, (DotNet) reference code).
On the other hand, the lack of it and my ability to make due, is a great source of income for me. üòâ

I reckon they should have left the toast-zinging in, then people would have had something good to say about Windows 8.

It may be that Microsoft was having a problem of too many postmodernism-indoctrinated arts students.
