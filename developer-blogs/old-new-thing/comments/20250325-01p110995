Isn’t that pretty much what the movie Smokey and the Bandit was about?

I had a work trip once where my hotel was reserved in Oswego New York, but I was working in Owego New York.  Closer than the 2 Atlantas, but not really desirable to drive across the state twice every day.

I wonder whose bright idea it was to have those two places in the same state, 150km apart.
Out of curiosity – when was this noticed and did your hotel booking get changed?

Atlanta, TX does have a general aviation airport, Hall-Miller Municipal Airport (ATA), but it does not have any regularly scheduled commercial flights.  I guess they could charter a flight for the winners there though.
Or other nearby options could be Texarkana Regional Airport (TXK) or Shreveport Regional Airport (SHV).
