Reminds me that back at Uni in the Chaplaincy there was a cobweb high in the ceiling. We used to joke that it was a load-bearing cobweb, and that was why it had never been removed.
Sure enough a few years later, some enthusiast cleaner got some scaffolding and cleaned the ceiling. A few weeks later cracks appeared in the walls and the building was condemned.

When the campus was opened the library was in building 2, on the second floor overlooking the lake.  The cafeteria was indeed on the first floor of building 4, but the second floor above that was the exec offices (Bill & Jon).  After a year or so they did add extra support pillars in the parking garage under building 2 (costing us maybe 1/3 of the sheltered parking), but the explanation at the time was that it was the weight of the machine room on the first floor that hadn't been taken into account.

Source: my first office was across the hall from the library, in building 2.

It‚Äôs stupid as I‚Äôve never even set foot anywhere on the American continent, but I can‚Äôt help but feel a little nostalgic and sad every time I read that the old MS campus is no more.
I imagine that there was a lot of old documentation there that a nerd like myself would enjoy a lot, and that maybe it was archived (like old arcane Windows 3.X stuff that everyone who worked on it wishes to forget).

‚ÄúThe weight of the books made the library sink because they failed to account for it in the design process‚Äù is a truly old-school urban legend, right up there with the hook-handed killer. I first encountered it on the alt.folklore.urban FAQ way back in the very early nineties, and it was long in the tooth by then. Probably every decently-sized library anywhere has been the subject of that claim at one time or another.

Ah yes, and the library eventually sinks to DLL (Descending Library Legend) Hell‚Ä¶ üôÇ
