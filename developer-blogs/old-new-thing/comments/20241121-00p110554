I don’t actually always want right-click to perform a full selection of the item that a left-click would do, either because selecting has a side effect (e.g. previewing or reading the item) or because I want to remove the item completely, and selecting it would defeat the object. Even when I’m not removing the right-clicked item, I’d often only want a temporary selection which reverts back to the original selection when the desired action completes.
