Used to work on Win/286 device drivers. Always remember the entry point in DDK – “BozosEndUpHere”. Wonder who coded that bit?

Don’t know about who specifically coded it, but Raymond actually posted a blog post about these entry points back in 2003.

“The caller specified wait timed out before the operation completed because a host termination is in queued”
There is a typo at the end.

Believe it or not, the typo is in the actual error message. Try it:  net helpmsg 3070

What should it print ?
All I get is :
D:\>net helpmsg 3070
memory

I assume it should say enqueued instead of in queued.

3070 = “memory” matches SERVICE_UIC_M_MEMORY in <LMSvc.h>. Is the other meaning of 0x80070bfe in any public header file?

Seems to be some sort of template message set for where the problem lies, if you continue on from 3070 you get memory, disk space, thread, process, lumbago, haemorrhoids, and arthritis.
