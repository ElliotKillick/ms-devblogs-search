Typo alert: OOBE is short for “out-of-box experience.” This is an industry-standard term. I’d gladly give you a dictionary definition link, but all my past comments with a hyperlink in them are awaiting moderator approval!

Well, if you bother to follow the link in the article, you will find out that in this (Microsoft) context Out of Box Experience is the “correct” term.
If you disagree, then you should file an issue over here https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs. (I’m not sure that this part of the docs has a repo there. You’d have to check)

You should get your eyes examined. The linked article (“Boot Windows to Audit mode or OOBE”) correctly spells the phrase in question as “Out-Of-Box Experience,” with appropriate hyphens.
Bonus reading: There has been a war called the hyphen war in 1989.

Raymond, I will pay you good money to update the version of the Sysprep Tool from 3.14.
