1) Me on reading the title: “How does one import a Translation Lookaside Buffer?  Oh, that’s a different TLB.”
2) The #import feature here is also not to be confused with a different #import feature in the Objective-C language, which works like #include but with guaranteed include-once semantics (equivalent of #pragma once or use of header guards).

#import was my doing, on the C++ compiler front-end team, a long time ago, probably around 1997.  I’m a little surprised it’s still supported, and not at all surprised it hasn’t seen much attention since then.  explicit certainly wasn’t a keyword back then.
It was, as you say, a weird little feature, aimed to help with VB6/VC6 integration as Henry Skoglund notes.  Delighted to see some mention of it, 25+ years later.

That the docs are “kind of sparse” is being generous.
Actually I think that the #import keyword has got a kind of bad wrap because the attributes for it are not well understood but they can be very helpful. For example I remember using “inject_statement” to insert #pragma pack()s for TLBs containing structs that was being used both from VB6 and VC6. Since the two languages packed structs differently the inject_statement: attribute was a lifesaver when #importing those TLBs from VB6 into VC6.
