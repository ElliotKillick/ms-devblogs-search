The problem with this proposal is that it undercomplicates the language. Sticking to English examples, it should bake, book, blaskhfawdlksajasdl. And make sure you note the position of the j, because blaskhfawdlksaajsdl (obviously!) means to mislead with intent to commit fraud. Thankfully computers will have no difficulty keeping track of that distinction, and in this era of AI humans probably won‚Äôt need to read (or write) much anyway.

There is a difference between ‚Äústrong‚Äù verbs (swim, swam, swum or give, gave, given), and ‚Äúirregular‚Äù verbs (am, was, been).

There are no rules but there are 3 pattern groups:
Same spelling in base/past-tense/past-participle:  put/put/put or set/set/set
Same spelling for past-tense/past-participle:  send/sent/sent or think/thought/thought
No holds barred anything goes leftovers:  fly/flew/flown or go/went/gone

Variation of first group:
Same spelling but different pronunciation in base/past-tense/past-participle: read/read/read

There are rules for strong verbs (which is what are being discussed).  See https://ianjamesparsley.wordpress.com/2020/01/17/strong-verbs-and-how-people-always-get-them-wrong/ for example.

I was skeptical at first, but ‚Äúbaken‚Äù convinced me.  Baken makes everything better.

I've found the RobWords YouTube channel to be an excellent historical tour of the English language, often connecting it with its German, French, Latin, Greek, and Scandinavian roots.
I believe he did a video on irregular verbs, which I can't find at the moment, but one of its surprising claims was that the more often a verb is used, the less likely it is to be become regular.
