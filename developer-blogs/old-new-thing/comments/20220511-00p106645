When you call widget.m_work.Cancel();, does that mean that attempting to await it will immediately throw a cancellation exception? (If you already covered that then sorry it must have been too long ago and I’ve already forgotten.)

Probable typo: I’m assuming it should be “you cannot Stop() without a preceding Start()“.
(But yeah, that’s not the point of this exercise.)
