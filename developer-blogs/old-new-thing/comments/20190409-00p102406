It’s kind of funny that about half of my “daily driver” programs invert this behavior, expecting it to happen. The end result is that now I never know if I’ll get the first or last selected item at the top of my upload queue!

Was the term “leaky abstraction” borrowed from Joel Spolsky or it’s the other way around?

That’s why I always select from bottom to top instead of top to bottom.

The whole story of context menu for multiple items is more complicated, and some verbs/submenus are suppressed from the context menu even if you just select multiple PDFs. I remember when I was a naive programmer, I just decided to move the first item last to get the “correct” order. Didn’t know this was related to focus!

Before Vista, the NSE helper function that creates the menu for you was limited to about 20 HKEYs so even if you wanted to, you could not put all the commands from all the different file extensions in one menu.

Hey, that’s cool that my submitted question was answered. Just for context, the reason I find this behavior annoying is when selecting a block of mp3s to play it will play the last one first (sometimes unimportant, but when the order of files is important (chapters, sountracks, musicals) can be irksome).

I read it several times but still do not fathom why it has to set the focsed item first just because it want to showi the context menu menu for the focused item. 
I think a better explanation can be:
some code want to show the context menu but it only has a list of items. it pick the first item.
some other code is handling gui selection. it always put the focused item at the top of the list because that other code always use the first item.

Alternatively use Ctrl+Click to deselect and then reselect whichever item you want to appear first. It will then have the focus. That’s what I do. (I figured out what it was doing).
Alternatively select the items from bottom to top so that the focused item is the first item.
