At least there seem to be a budget in time and money.

It happens a lot in app stores and software download sites. I'm looking for some kind of utility. I see in the search results an application with an interesting title and a nice icon. It looks promising, so I enter its page. But what I see in the description area is the changelog, or some vague description full of buzzwords saying it's free, respects your privacy (would it tell me if it didn't?), and is based on the Foo open source framework.
What I wanted to know is why do I have to choose it over the other dozen search results,...Read moreIt happens a lot in app stores and software download sites. I’m looking for some kind of utility.

What I wanted to know is why do I have to choose it over the other dozen search results, what makes it different from them. Surely, its developer thinks it’s so great that I will download and install it just to see. I’m not so sure. I go back to the search results and look for another one.

Sounds like a certain liquid related framework.
Announced to much fanfare, invite only, basic documentation, poor code examples, zero useful use cases, no service architecture explanation, no service guarantees, no help. But let’s all use it!

Frameworks are like that. We are starting a new project in 2022, so let's use the most recent framework. What do you say? There aren't any experts? The framework is basically a public beta, or even an alpha? Developers will be writing code for an API they don't master because just six months ago it didn't exist and even today is changing every week? Code quality is going to be, not bad, but awful? It doesn't matter! We will throw all the code in 2023 and rewrite it, based on the Next Big Thing. It doesn't matter if we torture...Read moreFrameworks are like that.

Glad to hear that I’m not the only one who is bothered by these things. It happens a lot. Similarly, there are acronyms that are never expanded. I am sure people who go to Xyz 25 are so used to calling it just “Xyz” that they forget that it actually stands for something and that others might not know what that something is. I have seen entire ads and websites that suffer from these problems.
