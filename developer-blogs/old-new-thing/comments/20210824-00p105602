I believe the ban was for Windows 2000. 98 and Internet Explorer releases before this had easter eggs. I think Office continued doing them.

I guess this piece of history kind of reveals why Microsoft C++ GUI stacks always had worse tooling than what the competition was offering since MS-DOS and Windows 3.0 days with Turbo Vision, OWL and MFC.
The Stockholm syndrome of using COM with C, is probably the reason why we then get WRL and C++/WinRT without any Visual Studio tooling support, while C++/CX gets the death row ticket.
Meanwhile VCL has been replaced by FireMonkey and C++ Builder has gone cross platform.
Microsoft some times seems too siloed on its own ways regarding productivity tooling.
So yeah COM can be done with C, and...Read moreI guess this piece of history kind of reveals why Microsoft C++ GUI stacks always had worse tooling than what the competition was offering since MS-DOS and Windows 3.0 days with Turbo Vision, OWL and MFC.

So yeah COM can be done with C, and anyone doing something similarity primitive nowadays should be heavily compensated to do so.

"Meanwhile VCL has been replaced by FireMonkey".
I wouldn't say that. I spend my days developing commercial Win32 VCL apps at work and non-commercial Win32 VCL apps at home.
I'd rather say that FMX is an alternative to the VCL, which you can use if you need cross platform support (or if you want a "modern" flashy GUI but is unable to design it yourself and you don't mind the GUI being buggy and inaccessible).
If you only require Win32 support (and in my world, there is no other OS), it is better to use the VCL.

Using Win32 + VCL, you can create amazingly stable GUI apps without any UI quirks. With FMX, you need to be very lucky if the end user doesn’t find a bug the first minute he or she tries the app.

Correct, I should have expressed myself better.
In any case, much better than the current C++ framework offerings from Microsoft.
Sometimes I wonder if they have no idea about the state of competition, and enjoy making C++ tooling a poor companion of .NET VS tools.

I don’t know about you, but I still don’t understand C++.

Were other parts of Win95 using C++?  C/C++ 7 shipped 1992, and around that time the Apps org was shipping MFC and the NT team had been using C++ (I believe in the graphics stack, but it’s been a while since I last read Showstopper).  Were any similar investigations happening in Windows at the time?
