Given 1) it runs Windows in standard mode, 2) the oddball setup instructions, 3) it will bomb trying to run a DOS program, it’s more like it was a design goal of Windows 3.0.
Somebody using dblspace got 386 Enhanced mode working on a floppy set of you had enough RAM (death if any code segments get discarded) but that clearly wasn’t intended and I can’t find it anymore.

I remember that early Macs could also run from floppies, but they made the mistake of putting the string for “Please insert disk” in a discardable resource, so you had to insert the boot disk first so that you could be prompted for the actual disk you needed to insert…

Hello Raymond, could you please write a blog post on transparency in Win32 bitmaps, especially in clipboard formats? The official documentation leaves a lot to be desired; as the result, many developers struggle with the correct implementation. See for example:

Many thanks.

The string IDs being 20-bit would be very nice and useful, if we could actually use it.
LoadString rejects values above 65535 and Microsoft Resource Compiler silently truncates all string IDs to lower 16 bits. But MinGW one gladly compiles them, and simple custom LoadString implementation (needed anyway due to security mitigations) will load them. I have this request open, but I’m not holding my breath.

This bundling of string resources has the unfortunate side effect of causing “CVT1100 Error duplicate resource”, even if you do not really have string resources with the same ids.
Consider this example:
File resource1.rc

STRINGTABLE
{
 1,        "Test 1"
}

File resource2.rc

STRINGTABLE
{
 2,        "Test 2"
}

The resources are different, but trying to have both files in the same VC++ project results in the CVT1100 error.

The first sentence of the last paragraph has a stray verb, “use.”

And you can run Windows on a floppy up through Windows 3.1. https://www.betaarchive.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=30904

That’s very impressive, and the fact that you can do it may suggest that it was a design goal at one point. But the method to set it up seems way too manual to be officially supported or intended.
