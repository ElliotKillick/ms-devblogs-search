Funny, just today i was perusing some code a contractor wrote and the build folder had the same file. Strangely enough, the code didn’t even deal with passwords of any kind

This reminds me a story of some guy who shared his personal mail’s login/password with his boss for some urgent task, and his password was a phrase from some popular game. Boss asked him what does this phrase mean (he didn’t know about game) and when guy explained, boss fine him for «Playing games at workplace».

And then there are companies not believing that because their own passwords are found in it.

Unsavory words, you say? Just hash the passwords; that ought to solve that issue, as well as somebody finding their (often reused) password in that file. The Have I Been Pwned password file hashes the passwords, too, if not to prevent personal data from leaking in.  I’m curious as to why Zxcvbn hasn’t done this?

Because then you lose access to the original password, which you need for trying variants of it.  For example if the base unsavory password is goshgollydarnit then you need to be able to mutate it into various popular password-strengthening forms like Goshgollydarnit, goshgollydarnit1, goshgollydarnit1234, Goshgollydarnit1, and so on, none of which you can do if it’s hashed.

Very interesting. I’ll definitely look into it.
And finally, I get to click that heart button in this blog. There. I did it. ❤

My first thought: Zxcvbn – what a weird name for a tool. Then even weirder – zxcvbn itself appeared in passwords.txt! To my defense – on my keyboard it’s yxcvbn, but I am pretty sure I wouldn’t have recognized yxcvbn either.

It sounds like just the sort of random sounding name you might want to use if you were in fact making malware. And then having `passwords.txt` inside of it! No wonder orgs are concerned about it.
