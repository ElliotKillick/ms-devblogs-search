Copy link
I once had to do this with Mercurial. It at least has the ability to record a file copy, which avoids jumping through the step of restoring the original file. However, despite the file being a copy, Mercurial still thinks that you want all of the same updates that were applied to the file in the mean time… I mean, if that’s what I wanted, I would just copy the latest version. It’s as if someone didn’t quite understand the concept of a copy. (Is that someone me?)
