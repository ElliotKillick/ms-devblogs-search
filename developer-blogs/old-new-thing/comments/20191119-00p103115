I wonder if you can discuss the Equation Editor story. Was it a similar build issue?

I‚Äôm wondering if the build machine in question used some sort of non-standard power switch, or if it didn‚Äôt occur to whoever was trying to run the build machines that front panel switches were standardized and they could‚Äôve just swapped one from a donor machine.
If it was an old AT style system with an AC power switch as implied by it popping out and turning the machine off, just make sure that power is disconnected first so you don‚Äôt zap yourself with 120VAC.

If it‚Äôs an old AT style switch you could just bypass the switch entirely and connect the respective L and N pairs together. Making sure you unplugged it first, of course.
(Over here you‚Äôd zap yourself with 240V).

Ah, the 2001-2003 period where Office 97 security updates was ‚Äúhotfixes‚Äù you had to request from PSS. They didn‚Äôt fix that until the last security update in November 2003 (it took until 2002 before these ‚Äúhotfixes‚Äù was even mentioned in the bulletins), though by September 2003 there was ‚Äúfar east‚Äù updates again for Word (I wonder when exactly they restarted the builds). You can see the last security bulletin for both Word 97 and Excel 97 here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/2003/ms03-050

Just found the Japanese MS03-050 here (notice the difference in the file information from the English version):

So that explains why Visual Studio has never made it easier to do multiple configuration builds at once ‚Äì you just have a separate computer for each configuration! üôÇ

Office 97 born before the age of Unicode, you have to run separate build for all language versions anyway at that time.

Office 97 used some Unicode, but there were still separate ‚ÄúFar East‚Äù and ‚ÄúMiddle East‚Äù builds.
