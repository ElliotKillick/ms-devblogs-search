Hi Raymond,
What would you recommend as an efficient way to bind a button within a DataTemplate to a Command in the page's ViewModel?
Quick example:

We often encounter situations where a page exposes a collection of items (models) that is bound to a ListView.
The ItemTemplate of such an element contains a button that should execute a Command in the page's ViewModel, with the element itself as the CommandParameter. Of course, there are various techniques, but how would you approach this in WinUI, where we don't have as rich binding capabilities as in WPF (e.g., RelativeSource AncestorType) ?

What would you recommend as an efficient way to bind a button within a DataTemplate to a Command in the page’s ViewModel?
Quick example:
<Page>
    <Page.DataContext>
        <vm:SampleViewModel />
    </Page.DataContext>
    <Page.Resources>
        <DataTemplate x:Key="ElementTemplate">
            <Grid>
                <Grid.ColumnDefinitions>
                    <ColumnDefinition Width="*" />
                    <ColumnDefinition Width="Auto" />
                </Grid.ColumnDefinitions>
                <TextBlock Text="{Binding Name}" />
                <Button Content="Remove" CommandParameter="{Binding }" Command="<- how to bind to Page.DataContext ? ->" />
            </Grid>
        </DataTemplate>
    </Page.Resources>
    <Grid Padding="40">
        <ListView ItemsSource="{Binding Elements}"
                  ItemTemplate="{StaticResource ElementTemplate" />
    </Grid>
</Page>

Of course, there are various techniques, but how would you approach this in WinUI, where we don’t have as rich binding capabilities as in WPF (e.g., RelativeSource AncestorType) ? Is there any efficient way to walk on the VisualTree outside this recycled part of element XAML ?
Creating a ViewModel with its own Command for each element seems a bit impractical, especially when dealing with thousands of such elements.
