Awesome story.  I remember well when NT was launched – I’ve used it since the first public beta and every release since then.

I guess when you have an exclusive world-wide contract to protect, with one of the largest tech companies in the world, then dedicating a driver and a plane to them for a single delivery is actually a pretty good investment.

If you bought a network card from HP in the early 1990s, an HP VP would charter a private plane and fly the card to your office on a silk cushion.
Or at least that’s what the price of the card seemed to imply.

Australian Air Express offer a service like that. You call them up and they send out a guy right away, he takes your package and goes direct to the airport, and your package goes on the next flight to the destination. at the other end another guy is waiting to take your package from the airport direct to the final destination.
I’m sure its not cheap, but sometimes you just have to get something somewhere as fast as possible.

I remember going to a demo for Windows NT around this time.
I’m sure there were lots of neat things shown but now, 25 years later, the only thing that stands out in my memory is they were immensely proud that they could now format a floppy disk and leave the rest of the system usable for other things.

Very cool story! Did Microsoft not own hardware like this for developing/testing NT on?

Sure, but they weren’t this fancy. And they never had to travel!

“Why do sales people get conferences in tropical locations?”
“Sales conference in Hawaii” is merely a euphamism for “Vacation at the employer’s expense”

It’s well understood that when people are in leisure mood, their guarding bar will be lowered, and makes it easier to negotiate a contract.
That’s why most contracts are signed after dinner and/or a few rounds of alcoholic drinks, and some company (including mine) have policies that explicitly forbids accepting “entertainment” provided by suppliers on the same day a contract is to be signed.
