hmmm how can you get a prompt a type someting if the previous command/executable is still running ? You can’t get a prompt, unless handled by the running executable.

You can obtain a handle to the console and write to it later – I’ve seen several programs that do that (which can be annoying, since I do a lot of work in FAR Manager, which is a console file manager). You can run a program, get the shell prompt (or in my case, the FAR UI) back, then the program you ran before starts spewing stuff to console.

OUCH!
The command processor only waits for “console” programs (since these use their parents console).
This is (or at least should be) basic knowledge.

start "title" /b command runs command in the current console without waiting for it.

There’s the kind of people who already know the obvious answer you will give them, but they believe that this answer isn’t appropriate in their case. Therefore they will try eagerly to make it look like a different case and distract you from that obvious answer, mostly by omitting any useful evidence. I had people getting angry at me when I demanded the missing information (“I will not do this because I have to believe it won’t help”).

Sounds like someone is absolutely certain they are right even though they can’t seem to get it to work, so they tried to give you a rigged demo of what they KNOW should be happening.
Like a medieval monk modifying a text he’s copying because he KNOWS for certain what it should say even though it, well, doesn’t…

You should’ve sent them a 45 minute video back of blackness, with a note explaining to the customer that this is the security team working on the problem, all 10,000 of them, but that security is so strong at Microsoft even the photons need permission to leave the premises.

I think that the appropriate course of action to this is to make a video of you typing “This was a waste of my time” into the ticket and clicking “Resolve”, then sending the video to the customer.
