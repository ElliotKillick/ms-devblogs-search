I’m pretty sure Resource Compiler supports
#pragma code_page(65001)

I don’t quite remember the details now, but I struggled a bit with the stringizing operator # in .rc files. I had the project’s version number kept as a MSBuild prop, then I passed that prop to the resource compiler as a preprocessor define (through the command-line). Somehow the rc.exe preprocessor didn’t quite do its work. Probably I had to use a separate .rc2 file that I then included in the main .rc file.

I have some .rc files that do this, and they use a two-step stringizing operation, i.e.
#define MAKE_STR_2(x) #x
#define MAKE_STR_(x) MAKE_STR_2(x)
