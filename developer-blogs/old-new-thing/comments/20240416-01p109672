For me the ‚ÄúBallmer Peak‚Äù is when Windows Phone 10 was about to take the market by storm, then was killed by Steve‚Äôs successor without a whimper.

Can‚Äôt be long until Tom7 (one of the SIGBOVIK organizers) uploads a new video to his YouTube channel ‚Äì if you don‚Äôt want to read all of the proceedings, or want to get an idea of the way of SIGBOVIK I highly recommend giving some of his videos a watch‚Ä¶ üòÄ
