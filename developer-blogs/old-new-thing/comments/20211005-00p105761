Hardly. The US has had auto trains 20 years before you did, in the 1970s. It makes sense due to the need of having a car in many metro areas, particularly vacation spots in Florida. They even let you carry trailers with boats, campers (caravans), and other recreational equipment. Search term: Amtrak Auto Train.
Besides that, the US has a much better freight rail network than Europe, and particularly the UK does.

Sure, this is a reasonable way to get a car across a small body of water. I am a Brit and I dated a nice Texan girl, and she flew across the ocean to visit me but had never actually seen the sea. So of course we went and dipped our toes.
