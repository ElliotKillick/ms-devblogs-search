As far as I can tell, ForwarderChain is unnecessary and it’s always possible to emit a binary for which it is zero. The documentation suggests it’s an initial index into OriginalFirstThunk, but on testing it I found no reason that OriginalFirstThunk can’t point to the right place to begin with.

I believe old Borland compilers produce a empty/zero OriginalFirstThunk.
