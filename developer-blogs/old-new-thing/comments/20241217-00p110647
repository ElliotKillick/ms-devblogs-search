I’m pretty sure that Synthetics still stuck around in Microsoft, referring to traffic generated for monitoring purposes (which helps identify health issues on systems, even when customers are not actively using those systems).

I don’t know when the meeting you are referring to happened, but in season 1 of Star Trek: Picard, they were suddenly using the word “synths” for androids (even though all previous Star Trek shows just used “androids”). Maybe your vice president was a fan?

Or maybe Mass Effect – Synthetics (artificial life – Geth) versus Organics (regular life, humans,… ).

“Synthetic traffic” usually refers to traffic generated by automation as opposed to “organic traffic” from users.
