For example, a team might casually say that “The widget sends a message to another widget”, when really what happens is that the widget controller sends the message to the other widget’s controller.
This phenomenon is called metonymy. It is a feature of the English language.
To people who work with widgets and widget controllers all day, this is just a handy abbreviation, but for people who are just learning about widgets and widget controllers, this shorthand just adds to the confusion.
The truth is quite the opposite.

the people who know the most about a feature are the least qualified to write documentation about it
Early in my career, the company I worked for did this thing I always wish would have caught on. In lieu of code reviews, each programmer would hand off his code to another and that programmer would write the comments for it.
The result was that the comments were written from the point of view of someone trying to understand the code. The same point of view as the person who would later read them.

it’s always kind of interesting to me that the original meaning of “inside baseball” was something totally different — it referred to a style of play that is now called “small ball”, wherein the focus is on infield play rather than power hitting.  when the term was heard in wider audiences, it took on the more general meaning that’s used today.  so the original phrase was kind of an inside baseball term that was misunderstood when it spread.

Here’s the Merriam Webster discussion: https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/the-inside-scoop-on-inside-baseball.  I grew up watching the Montreal Expos under manager Gene Mauch (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Mauch).  He was the master of the small ball game.

You might say that the term “inside baseball” was itself inside baseball.

No, it is the opposite of ironic. It is a hyponym for “Microspeak.”
