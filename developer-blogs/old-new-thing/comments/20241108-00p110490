My first thought when just reading the title and one line summary was “That’s some severe partying”. Seems like there was a wild party indeed.

I remember the case of a crash that I submitted to Microsoft and the automated response was “hey, you might need to update driver X”. Problem was, driver X was malware of some sort. I hope the automation has improved since then to say “hey, this could have been caused by malware, check that your security software is running and up-to-date”. That response could then be used for this crash too.

Another fascinating problem dissection, thank you!
As someone who reads assembly very infrequently, I appreciated the C equivalence that you provided. Within that, I notice that the func addresses used in `if` and `else` are the same. My reading of the assembly has them as different. Is this a typo? Also, is it correct to redeclare `p` as a uint64_t within the while loop? Maybe you meant to not declare it on the line previous to the while?

The first thing I thought of: some kind of packer or obfuscator was used.
