Depending on the data size and what I’m trying to do with the data (say, if I need to bind more than a dozen properties and I know the list of properties to bind will be extended a lot of times in future), I would probably just “var rwTeams = new List(Teams)” then use rwTeams to bind instead.

Typo in the link to the XAML docs (first link in the post) – x-bind-markup-exension is missing the t in extension.
