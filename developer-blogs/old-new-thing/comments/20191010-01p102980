Note that national UK trains are truly insane when it comes to pricing. People frequently resort to "split ticketing" whereby they buy multiple tickets (e.g. A->B and B->C) as it's a lot cheaper than one (i.e. A->C) even when the alternatives involve sitting in the same seat on the same trains.
For a good laugh, look up the price for London (King's Cross) [KGX] to Holyhead [HHD], and then King's Cross to Dublin [DPS] which is the same train with added ferry across the Irish Sea. Adding a ferry crossing halves the price! So you're being paid to take the ferry.

Hampton Court and Earl‚Äôs Court are both within the TfL travel area, Zone 6 and Zone 1 respectively. The TfL site is telling you how much a single off peak ticket from Zone 1 to Zone 6 costs, using Oyster or other TfL ticket (¬£3.10)
If you ask the South Western or National Rail sites for the cost of a ticket from Wimbledon to Hampton Court they will tell you the cost of a mainline National Rail ticket between the two stations (¬£4.50), not the cost of travelling between Wimbledon and Hampton Court using Oyster (¬£1.50).

Thanks, Chris. So I‚Äôm guessing that I don‚Äôt need to buy tickets or touch in/out at Wimbledon station, just change trains and touch out when I get to Hampton Court. Let the system figure out what happened.

Earl‚Äôs Court is in Z1/2 so the Zone 2-6 fare would apply here.

Use http://www.nationalrail.co.uk for train times and prices, you buy paper tickets from machines at the station. (you can reserve online and maybe get advanced fares that are cheaper, but requires a fair bit of preplanning). Generally you are just dealing with peak (commuter times) or off peak fares ‚Äì day returns are usually only marginally more expensive than a single fare.

Thanks! Now I just need to put this information into that time machine I saw over in Earl‚Äôs Court, and send it to myself a few months ago.

Pro tips: If you plan to travel to a country you‚Äôre not familiar with the traffics etc., and then you know friends that lives there, ask them for tips before planning. XD
Note: There are things like ‚ÄúHong Kong Pass‚Äù which even the local people rarely know about it.

Trains in the UK work similar to most other industries here, which is very similar to the coupon culture of the US.
If you‚Äôre prepared to trawl through all the many different options to find a deal, then you‚Äôll usually get one. If you‚Äôre not, then you subsidize those who are.
If you are only here on a short holiday and haven‚Äôt done your research before you arrive, then you should just enjoy your trip. You may get ripped off, but hopefully you won‚Äôt find out.

It‚Äôs fine to show the regular non-discounted price. Just show the same regular non-discounted price. Showing different prices at different sites is downright confusing.

TfL price would have been for Oyster - https://www.ltfares.com/!fares?orig=LUECT&dest=NRHMC , South Western Railway price would have been for a paper ticket (Wimbledon to Hampton Court) - http://www.brfares.com/#faredetail?orig=WIM&dest=HMC&rte=1000&tkt=SDS . As you discovered with the tube, Oyster and Contactless are cheaper than paper tickets to encourage people to use them. You're really overcomplicating things here! But then, overcomplicated is how I'd generally describe our country's rail fares, so it's understandable :D
As for trains in general, only overnight sleeper trains and Eurostar require reserved seats - all other trains you can just turn up and buy a ticket there and then.

As for trains in general, only overnight sleeper trains and Eurostar require reserved seats ‚Äì all other trains you can just turn up and buy a ticket there and then. Though as others have mentioned, it‚Äôs often cheaper to buy in advance, if you want the flexibility of choosing your train at the last minute you don‚Äôt have to book. I‚Äôm putting this for the benefit of others who might be interested in visiting the UK, or for you for future visits! When buying flexible tickets, return (what you would call ‚Äúround trip‚Äù) tickets are usually much better value than singles; a single often being nearly the same price as a return.

There may be contractual terms and consumer protection laws that prevent them doing so.
Whenever visiting the UK, it‚Äôs worth checking moneysavingexpert.com. They have a lot of articles and a forum you can ask questions, although you should keep it UK centric. Their choice of a .com address means that people ask questions about the US and nobody has a clue about that.

Last time I visited London (2012), I got an Oyster card.. When I returned to Heathrow to fly out, there was a staffed ticket kiosk that I was able to turn in my card to for a refund. I believe the refund included the original ¬£5 deposit (the total refund was around ¬£7). I spent the cash on food in the airport, leaving the couple pounds I had left as a tip, returning to the US with only dollars.

Regional trains are a lot easier when you realise you are simply buying a permit to travel between the two locations. Buying ahead of time or on a specific train may save money, but it tends to vary quite highly. It's not necessary to book a specific seat and if you do you may not get it anyway because occasionally they just don't bother reserving specific seating (phase of the moon stuff) - seasoned Brit train users rarely bother looking for any seat they may have got reserved so even when traveling you can often get away with sitting in...Read moreRegional trains are a lot easier when you realise you are simply buying a permit to travel between the two locations.

Working out the cheapest price in advance is literally a whole cottage industry. If you‚Äôre buying on the day a ticket machine will mostly do it for you (but you need to understand when ‚Äúpeak times‚Äù are) but for a traveler I‚Äôd suggest buying a ticket in person as.the staff will usually be helpful in sorting out the quirks that can save you money.

The last time I was in London I recall there being possible issues with foreign contactless payment cards, this was last summer so it may have changed, I ended up getting a visitor oyster card instead which lacks the online features but may give you discounts at various places.
As for regional trains within the London zone system you can use them just like the underground. Scan to get in, scan to get out.

As for regional trains within the London zone system you can use them just like the underground. Scan to get in, scan to get out. If you are going outside of London you generally have to buy specific station to station tickets. National rail oversees rail services in the UK but the trains themselves are ran by individual companies that maintain specific routes (Great Western Railway, South Western Railway, East Midlands Railway etc.). When you go to buy a ticket from National rail it‚Äôll tell you what trains are available. You can buy train tickets from the station but it‚Äôs cheaper to buy them in advance and opt to pick them up at the station. Some trains have you select specific seats and others let you sit anywhere.
I found the advanced fare system to be very interesting. There are multiple tiers of advance fares and it seems like each has a set number. As advanced fares are purchased and that number is reached that specific advance fare becomes unavailable and you are offered the next more-expensive tier. The interesting thing is that the website allows you to select from all the advance fare options just in case you want to pay more.
