The same thing can happen with creating files or directories: if any parent directory in the path being created doesnâ€™t exist, then the syscall will fail with ENOENT (POSIX) / ERROR_PATH_NOT_FOUND (Windows).  Windows at least has the two separate error codes ERROR_PATH_NOT_FOUND and ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND, so users can distinguish between parent directory not found vs. the leaf file not being found (for non-creating open dispositions), whereas POSIX makes no such distinction.
