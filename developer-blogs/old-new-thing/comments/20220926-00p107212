This article reminded me of “Toast created but not shown: did you forget to call show()?”
Yes, this is from first-hand experience!

If you *really* want to refer to a bound function without “calling” it yet (as in you need an expression that is callable, but in a context where you don’t just call it right away), you can use a lambda:
    [&v](auto …p){ return v.front(p…); }
Note that using a generic lambda also has the advantage of deferring overload resolution until the context where the resulting expression is called. (Also, this should probably use perfect forwarding, but that would make it too hard to read for this context.)

Or you switch between C# and C++ way too often and accidentally mistake this method with a property and try to get it like one.
