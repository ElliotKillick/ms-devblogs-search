Also AfxGetCurrentMessage exists, ( VS2019). I can confirm that GetMessage() works also, I’ve been using it in one special case and it still compiles correctly ( also works correctly).

> There apparently used to be a CWnd::GetCurrentMessage() function for getting a copy of the current message being handled by MFC. (I don’t know this for sure, but I see references to it.) It doesn’t exist anymore (or maybe never existed), so it’s not really an option.
Well, CWnd::GetCurrentMessage certainly seems documented: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/mfc/reference/cwnd-class?view=msvc-170#getcurrentmessage and I see it in the afxwin header at the top of the CWnd class as a protected member, so not sure where that statement comes from.
