I often use the old CUA shortcuts for cut and paste, Shift-Del and Shift-Insert

A lot of applications let you right-click and ‚Äúpaste as‚Äù. Office apps, Outlook for example.

I‚Äôm yet to figure out why anyone would ever want to paste something else than plain text when copy and paste is not done inside the same application. It would be nice to be a able to force plain text paste globally on Windows.

You never paste between Office applications? Like a range of spreadsheet cells into Word or Powerpoint? Or a Visio diagram into Word or Powerpoint?

I use a clipboard manager (Ditto), which includes an option to paste as plain text.

I do the same, only with Win+R instead of Ctrl-Esc

Slightly easier than the run dialog _and_ works with multiline:
1. Windows button
2. Ctrl-v
3. Ctrl-a or shift-up
4. Ctrl-x üòâ

Nice shortcuts, I usually also use my favourite text editor.
Hall of Shame Top 1: Eclipse (Yes, I‚Äôm forced to use it) . It copies the text with blue color and blue background (as it‚Äôs selected).
This clearly shows nobody of the dev team ever used it themselves.

On Windows 11 (possibly only in insider builds?) the Win+V hotkey has ‚Äúpaste as plain text‚Äù functionality in addition to clipboard history. It‚Äôs behind the ‚Ä¶ menu for the clipboard item. If you hate using the mouse, as I do, it‚Äôs Win+V, tab, enter, enter to paste the current clipboard contents as plain text.

Tried Ctrl+Alt+V in my Word 2003. Doesn‚Äôt work. Luckily a single-line macro for Ctrl+Alt+Shift+V just works.
Yes, better UX than Gibbon is more important than having a newer version. A lot of people around tend to do the same, compatibility package is enough to work with the rest.
P.S. Win+R seems to only work for single-line text.

I‚Äôve used the Run dialog trick myself since the beginning of formatted text. I thought it was just me. I kind of thought there must be a better way but I didn‚Äôt know about it, but this post proves there isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs probably the single most annoying thing about my usage of computers. I have almost never wanted to retain formatting when copying and pasting from web content or anywhere else, yet removing it requires a load of actions.
