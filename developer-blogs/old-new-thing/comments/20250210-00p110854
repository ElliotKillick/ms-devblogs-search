I ended up using ExtractIconExW using Rust a while ago to extract icons from an exe, I was quite pleased to get it working despite having no idea what I’m doing

Hallo Herr Chen!
I am currently investigating how resources are loaded by Windows, and since you just wrote about locales and icon resources, would you be willing to shed some light on how non-ASCII lowercase letters in resource names work? I'm having trouble loading resource names containing e.g. an <code> character, see: Issue with Win32 API Loading of PE Resources Containing Lowercase Letters.
I tried using <code> from your previous blog post, but without success, as I guess Win32 APIs may not be influenced by this function.
Would be very appreciated.
Thanks!

I think that is making the assumption that it is the Win32 APIs that are at fault.
If this is a bug in rc.exe then it will look the same.

Hello,
I think that the closing parenthesis of EnumResourceNamesW is missing. Should be … , reinterpret_cast(&icon));
Regards.
