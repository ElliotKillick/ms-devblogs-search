I don‚Äôt recommend using soap, as it is much more corrosive to metals than a more neutral lubricant like wax (paraffin). I grew up learning to soap up screws before driving them into wood, but I later learned that soap would corrode the screws.

I've never had a bulge in a bicycle tire.  Tubes, yes, when I've inflated them outside of a tire.  I do that when testing a tube for air leaks.  Any noticable bulges in the tube aren't noticable when it's installed in the wheel and tire.  The tire casing constrains the expansion to the tube so that the bulge doesn't form.
As for installing a tube (and I do prefer TPU tubes over tubeless), I start by installing one side of the tire inm the wheel, then very slightly inflating the tube and seating it into the tire....Read moreI‚Äôve never had a bulge in a bicycle tire.

As for installing a tube (and I do prefer TPU tubes over tubeless), I start by installing one side of the tire inm the wheel, then very slightly inflating the tube and seating it into the tire.  The valve stem goes through the hold, and if it‚Äôs threaded, I install a nut, but my current tubes are unthreaded.  Then I squeeze the other side of the tire into the wheel‚Äôs well.  I install the wheel in the bike and pump up the tube to 55-60 psi.  I normally run at 25-30 psi.  The extra pressure helps seat the tire in the wheel.  Once I confirm proper seating, I drop the pressure down to my normal riding level.

What an unusual topic for the blog!
What you should do is:
1. With only one side of the tire on the rim, put tube's valve into the hole an tighten the nut. This is needed so that valve is perpendicular to the rim (points towards the center of the wheel, not to the side).
2. Put the rest of the tube. Go symmetrically from valve and meet on the other end. If you didn't secure the valve, you can move it so it looks bent. Also this is when you make sure that tube is not twisted and evenly distributed...Read moreWhat an unusual topic for the blog!
What you should do is:
1. With only one side of the tire on the rim, put tube‚Äôs valve into the hole an tighten the nut. This is needed so that valve is perpendicular to the rim (points towards the center of the wheel, not to the side).
2. Put the rest of the tube. Go symmetrically from valve and meet on the other end. If you didn‚Äôt secure the valve, you can move it so it looks bent. Also this is when you make sure that tube is not twisted and evenly distributed (older tubes can be stretched). It also helps to properly distribute the tube if you inflate it slightly, so it looks like a doughnut.
3. Now it‚Äôs time to put the second half of the tire. If you inflated the tube ‚Äì release the air. Otherwise it will be difficult to put on tire, because you want it to be in the middle of the rim (where the kind of cavity is, not the seated on the side) ‚Äì this is especially important if you‚Äôre putting winter or stiffer tires.
4. Internet says and I just follow the advice to go from the part of the rim opposite to the valve, symmetrically, meeting at the valve. As I said, if tire is stiff, try to push it to the middle of the rim and pull towards valve (to create as much slack as you can at the ‚Äúmeeting point‚Äù). This is also the point where you may want to apply some soap to make tire glide into the rim. I didn‚Äôt use tools to finish putting tire on the rim, even with winter tires and bloody stiff tubeless GP 5000 (but I had pain in fingers for couple days).
5. Now, we need to inflate it properly. Here are tricks. First, unscrew the valve nut. While inflating, you want to push valve into the tire, so nothing prevents beads to get properly on the rim. You can do it for 1-1.5 bar, then it will be hard (and pointless). Second trick, if you do it planned at home  (not an on-road repair) is to apply soap to tire and rim. Even if you put on tire effortlessly, having some glide while inflating drastically increases chances that tire will be seated nicely. I used a cloth with regular soap, but recently switched to small spray bottle, spraying into the gap between the tire and the rim.
That‚Äôs basically it. Then you inflate the tire. Go to max pressure (some tires just plop onto the rim) and then release air to the desired pressure. I tried to inflate to <1bar and adjust tire if it's not symmetrical, but soap does wonders.
It is much longer to read this than to do, with a bit of practice. I have 4-5 bikes in family which we use daily and I change tires every spring and fall on all of them for several years now üôÇ Plus countless tube repairs.
So, TL;DR; for your original question ‚Äì you first tighten the nut, then unscrew.
Have a safe ride!

You should partially inflate the tube, just enough to make it easier to insert in to the tire, before tightening the valve-stem nut, then fully inflate the tube.  This makes it far easier to insert the tube  without kinks and helps avoid getting it caught between the rim and the tire, which will cause a flat (or even a blow out) if it happens.
The nut isn‚Äôt required, but really helps inflate the tube when the pressure is very low, especially when you have a tube with a very short valve-stem.
