There’s a nonsense poem in the Unix fortune file that refers to “hard errors”. In that context, it probably means “hard[ware] errors”, and that’s the interpretation I’d have placed on the phrase before reading this article.

It is also consistent with the Windows usage meaning “low-level critical error”.

Long, long ago, when Windows 3.1 ruled the world and source control wasn't something most people had even heard of, I worked for a company that no longer exists writing software that no longer exists, and we kept all of our source code on a shared network drive. Whenever we would run a build, we'd invariably run into a sharing violation because someone else was also doing a build and was accessing a file we needed. This was annoying, because it meant you couldn't start a build and go get a cup of coffee, because it'd just be sitting on...Read moreLong, long ago, when Windows 3.1 ruled the world and source control wasn’t something most people had even heard of, I worked for a company that no longer exists writing software that no longer exists, and we kept all of our source code on a shared network drive. Whenever we would run a build, we’d invariably run into a sharing violation because someone else was also doing a build and was accessing a file we needed. This was annoying, because it meant you couldn’t start a build and go get a cup of coffee, because it’d just be sitting on an error dialog when you returned.
If my memory is accurate, the sharing violation dialog was one of those hard error boxes.
The first solution we found for this was to bend a paperclip into a sort of hook shape that you could place on top of the R key, press down, and hook under the 5 key. This would hold down the R key for you, automatically retrying any sharing violations while you enjoyed your coffee. It also helped to unplug your PC speaker, for the sake of your teammates.
For some reason, probably that PC speaker thing, we didn’t think that solution was sufficiently elegant. So, one day while I was bored, and probably with the help of Schulman, Maxey, and Pietrek’s “Undocumented Windows,” I sat down and wrote a little program whose sole purpose in life was to detour whichever function brought up those message boxes. (This worked because Windows 3.1 didn’t have separate process memory – every process used the same copies of every DLL.) The detour would look to see if the message started with the word “Sharing,” and if it did, it would automatically return the “Retry” result 49 times out of 50. (Thus giving you an opportunity to cancel if it really was unrecoverable.)
So, at least in the case of a tiny handful of developers in a tiny rural town in northeast Indiana, there was a little bit of application code running during a hard error state.

(And y’all can put down your torches and pitchforks. We did eventually spring for a license for that newfangled “SourceSafe” thing, unfortunately before Microsoft bought out One Tree Software and, again IIRC, made it available through our existing MSDN subscription.)
