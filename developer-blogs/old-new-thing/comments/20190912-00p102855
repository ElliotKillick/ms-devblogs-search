Like when trying to compile this code on Solaris:
enum solar_system {
  earth,
  jupiter,
  mars,
  mercury,
  neptune,
  pluto,  // obviously this is outdated code
  saturn,
  sun,    // incomprehensible error message here
  uranus,
  venus
};

Raymond: do you mean ‘first letter’ rather than ‘final letter’? or am I just too much of a literalist and construe that to be the final letter of the currency name (not an L for Lira!). when one says ‘final letter from the name of the currency’.  I’d say the final letter is the first letter from the name of the currency.  But then, I often see gray when others see black or white, and vice versa.

No, it makes sense if you parenthesize it correctly, and the previous part of the sentence establishes the context for the right grouping: “taking (the first two letters) (from the [country code]) and (the final letter) (from the name of the currency)”.

I revised the sentence to make the parentheses a bit more explicit. Thanks for pointing it out.

Or give all the names in the enum a short common prefix, which I know is considered uncool and downright sinful nowadays but it works

It seems some work is being done to support C++ modules in C++/WinRT: #462, #574. When this work is complete, is `import <winrt/Windows.Globalization.h>` going to work even if TRY has been defined as a macro?
