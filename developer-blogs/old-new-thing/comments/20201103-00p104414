When in Windows 10 did this feature show up? It doesn‚Äôt seem to appear in Windows 10 Enterprise 1709. In that version there is no ‚ÄúCursor & Pointer‚Äù under Ease of Access. There are pointer options under mouse, but no option for a custom color.

In Enterprise 2004, it‚Äôs just called ‚ÄúMouse Pointer‚Äù under Ease of Access (at least on my machine.)

Yes, I saw that. But a custom color isn‚Äôt in the options. So that means it‚Äôs not supported in that version of Win10 or it‚Äôs removed by Group Policy from the my corporate managed domain.

Back in the Windows 2000 era or earlier, you could use a hex editor to set the transparency bits on the parts of the cursor that were supposed to be coloured, which resulted in a somewhat psychedelic effect.
Nowadays the code to draw mouse pointers is different, but other effects might still be possible. Who knows?

You never *needed* a hex editor; .cur is just a .ico (which has transparency support) with a special hot spot field that defines the pixel the cursor is centered on. There has always been plenty of software for editing them. The modern icons are exactly the same, just with the extended ICO format that supports larger icons at 32bit.

I had no idea you could change the mouse colour cause I never thought to look in the mouse accessibility options. decided to change the mouse colour on my tv computer to bright yellow. feels like its more visable sitting on my couch. no idea if it actually is but the colour seems to make it pop more than white does.

Yellow is indeed perceptually ‚Äúbrighter‚Äù than white to the human eye.

Artisanal, hand-crafted mouse cursor ‚Äì sounds like you found a lost episode of Portlandia!

Now a better question is where are these stored.

Generated cursor files are stored in:
%localappdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Cursors\

I don‚Äôt think the answer would be useful for any interesting goal‚Ä¶ If a program wants to get/set the current cursor set, it can do so by reading/writing the cursor preferences. And the files are presumably not generated if a user has never used this feature.

Somewhere not programmatically accessible, one fervently hopes.

Sincerely, if some intern solves this problem by using file search and Windows 10 2104 (or 21H1, or whatever it is called) breaks it, then s/he deserves it. The bad part is that in those cases it‚Äôs Microsoft who gets the blame‚Ä¶ but nobody said this world is fair üôÅ .
