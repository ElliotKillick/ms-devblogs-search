Would if constexpr (false) co_return 0; mean that the function is no longer a coroutine again?

I suppose another option is to use an IILE:
co_await []() -> std::suspend_never { throw winrt::hresult_access_denied(); }();
I’m not sure of any compiler that would warn about this, and the throw happens before co_await gets to do anything. I suppose this works with co_return too since you never actually have to provide a value, and that means you can use it even when co_await isn’t allowed, and when co_return takes void.
co_return []() -> return_type { throw winrt::hresult_access_denied(); }();
