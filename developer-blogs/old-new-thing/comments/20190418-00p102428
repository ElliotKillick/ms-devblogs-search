My favourite field in the TEB is Win32ThreadInfo. It points to a THREADINFO structure *in kernel-mode memory*. A kernel-mode pointer in user-mode memory is never a good sign…

Going a way back to CDC KRONOS, the manuals said that for each directory entry there was a “USERCONTROLWORD”.  Neat, we thought, 60 bits where we could stuff some file meta-info.  
But if you talked to the system programmers, they said “WE are the users!”  So they stole 12 bits to store the file’s language.  Then the computer science department decided they were going to use all the other bits to implement a crude user-id convention. 
Are any of the Windows file system fields still up for grabs?

Any extended attribute that doesn’t start with a “$” is fair game under IBM’s rules, I couldn’t immediately find Microsoft’s rule (quit moving pages) but assume it to be the same from the naming on the article.  At any rate, use a Java-format reverse domain name to prefix your attribute, and the odds Microsoft would ever pick that same name for an attribute would be so near to zero to be zero.

Note that the linked article mentions that the loader only borrows the member. The loader restores whatever value was there in case anyone cares.
