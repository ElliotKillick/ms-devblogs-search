Something I once heard: “Every bug is a security bug, if you report it right.”
That’s a pro-tip, if you ever want to make sure a bug is triaged as high priority..  “it crashes!  this is a denial-of-service vulnerability!”. 😉

TLDR; I executed your program incorrectly and it crashed 😂
I’d love to see a new series on your blog of things that turned out to be actual security vulnerabilities.

Re executing outside the AppContainer environment, I had assumed that setting the IMAGE_DLL_CHARACTERISTICS_APPCONTAINER bit would cause CreateProcess to return an error if PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_SECURITY_CAPABILITIES is not provided.  But now that I tried it, the process started without an AppContainer anyhow.  What’s the real effect of IMAGE_DLL_CHARACTERISTICS_APPCONTAINER?
