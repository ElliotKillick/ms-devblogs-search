Those 16 empty slots seem like a waste of 64/128 bytes; I suppose the delegate objects all have a shared fixed layout?

sizeof(T) must be the same regardless of what’s in T. Go figure. This is an example of the so-called small buffer optimization. It’s used by std::string, std::vector, and std::function. (std::function being the closest analogue to C++/CX delegates.) So what you consider a waste others consider an optimization.

Am I reading this right? In “C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Professional\VC\Tools\MSVC\14.16.27023\include\vccorlib.h”, Platform::Details::__abi_CaptureBase::__smallCaptureSize = 4 * sizeof(void*) is used as the number of pointers in Platform::Details::__abi_CapturePtr::smallCapture, but as the number of bytes in Platform::Details::__abi_CaptureBase::operator new. So on 32-bit, you get 4*4*4 = 64 bytes, of which only 4*4 = 16 bytes are ever used; and on 64-bit, you get 4*8*8 = 256 bytes, of which only 4*8 = 32 bytes are ever used.
