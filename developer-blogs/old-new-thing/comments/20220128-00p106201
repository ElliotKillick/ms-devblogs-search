The SMB protocol (also known as CIFS) can get into a situation where a single share maps to multiple file systems, which means that the unique identifier is itself just an approximation.
Not quite, no. Only SMB 1 is referred to as CIFS. And if I am not mistaken, the behavior you are explaining is a feature of SMB 2.

For those that want to compare if two handles refer to the same file object in memory (as in same instance of the file being opened), use the CompareObjectHandles function. As the post implies, it will not work if the same file is opened multiple times. File objects are not the same as files, have fun philosophing about that.
