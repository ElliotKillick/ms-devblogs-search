I was recently adding access controls to an application, and i was wrining my hands about whether or not users should be allowed to see the DACL.
“If they see the DACL; then they could see the names of other users! Oh nose!”
Then i calmed down; because if it’s good enough for Windows NT, and it’s C2 security rating, then it’s good enough for a LoB application.

For a fun time, set a deny ACL for SYNCHRONIZE for some file and watch things explode.
It’s very easy to do this by accident when trying to deny write permission to a file with a deny rule. Some of the builtin windows tools (either presently do or used to) do it by using the macros to construct the deny ACL and FILE_GENERIC_WRITE contains SYNCHRONIZE.
If you don’t have SYNCHRONIZE, some programs work opening the file for read and some don’t and there’s no rhyme or reason to which ones.

It probably fails for applications that try to wait on the file handle.
