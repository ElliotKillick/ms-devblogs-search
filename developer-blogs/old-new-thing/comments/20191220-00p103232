I can’t help feeling that InvokeInContext doesn’t have the semantics you want when you’re trying to return a value, as you’re not actually interested in the result of the action that you’re invoking; something along the lines of DispatchInContext would be more suitable, although I guess that doesn’t actually exist?

Nothing to do with this post, but does anyone remember the post telling the story of a friend who was on some kind of industry task force building an API or a specification or something? It splintered into two groups and they ended up categorizing features as core or extended or something, and it ended up that everyone adopted the core anyway? I can’t find it. It would be kind of funny if Mr. Chen didn’t write it but was on some other Microsoft blog, but I do remember at least that the reading journey began here.
