I was kinda hoping for an overview of Calvinball…
“Other kids’ games are all such a bore! They’ve gotta have rules and they gotta keep score! Calvinball is better by far! It’s never the same! It’s always bizarre! You don’t need a team or a referee! You know that it’s great, ’cause it’s named after me!”

You might also consider covering Rounders, it is of course very close to baseball (based on your description) but with less complex rules

Raymond, I am most impressed by your ability to read so many languages! A question then arises – if you were to add the count of Programming languages that you are versed in to your total, what number do you reach?

“Pesä” in Finnish means nest, as in birds nest, which gives you a clue about the origin of the Swedish name boboll, where bo is a literal translation. 🙂
If you are into these fringe sports, don’t miss the Swedish game brännboll, or brennball auf Deutsch, here you see the expression “burn” is used in the name itself:

Brännboll is common in school PT in Sweden, and sometimes in poorly planned social outings at workplaces.

I considered covering brännboll, but the lack of a governing body means that the rules are basically “whatever everybody agrees on.” Though I guess I could lay out the general game principles, so if you’re in Sweden at a poorly-planned social outing, and somebody suggests playing brännboll, you can join in.

I live in a rugby-mad country. We have a similar game called Mugby, with rules that are similarly vague, but hinted at by the name.
