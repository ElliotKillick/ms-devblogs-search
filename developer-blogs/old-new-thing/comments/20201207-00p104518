I have a sneaky suspicion that this little trick must have caused some cursing for the NT folks when they found it. It probably meant they had to re-write it the way the ABI describes it and not the fun little way the prior dev did. That said… even in the early NT days bytes cost serious money.

I always wondered about that and thought it must have something to do with the calling convention and compatibility. Thanks for clearing it up.
It also shows that the design of this function call is not optimal. The team did a better job on the RegisterWindow/RegisterWindowEx functions, where you only pass a pointer to a struct instead of a dozen or more parameters. But the structs (WNDCLASS/WNDCLASSEX) are still inconsistent because the latter has an additional first parameter, so how does it work here? Does RegisterWindowEx forward to the RegisterWindow function, with the WNDCLASSEX pointer incremented to kind of cast it...Read moreI always wondered about that and thought it must have something to do with the calling convention and compatibility.

Agree. My first thought was also “why not a struct?”
