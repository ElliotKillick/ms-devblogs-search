Your table uses IIterable for C++/CX, but your text uses IEnumerable (or sometimes IEnumeraable).
It might be possible to create a user-defined conversion operator from IEnumerable<Vector<Point>> into a IEnumerable<IEnumerable<Point>>, but it still doesn’t directly help you because that’s two casts away from your original Vector<Vector<Point>> so it won’t happen automatically.

the covariance in c# seems a bit weird compared to other languages  but it’s a nice feature to have and its something a beginner to generics might assume is how things should work
