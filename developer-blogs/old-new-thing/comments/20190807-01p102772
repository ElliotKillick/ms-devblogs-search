On an unrelated note. I just read your book. Two observations. 1) I‚Äôve never seen it from the side and I didn‚Äôt realize how many pages are in it. 2) It was such a facinating read that I‚Äôd finished it in two days. (Didn‚Äôt know that I can read this fast.)Thus a question. The book covers pre-2006 state of affairs in Windows development Do you plan on writing a sequel for 2006-2019 period?
