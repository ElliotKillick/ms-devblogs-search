Just like the system state monitor gadget on Vista, that‚Äôs something that some system admins missed.

There used to be something called a Charms bar which I think did a similar thing.
I don‚Äôt remember the canonical way to make it appear, but at least one touchpad manufacturer decided to implement a shortcut using a touchpad gesture: swipe into the touchpad with one finger from the right (starting outside it). Unfortunately that is already the gesture for a very common and mundane thing: ‚ÄúI want to move my cursor to the left a lot‚Äù.
Ooops.

The keyboard shortcut to activate / display / summons / descry / dredge up / entice the Charms bar on WIndows 8.X is apparently:
WIndows Logo Key + Shift + C
Never having actually used Windows 8 or 8.1, the things a Charms bar might entail have been left to my imagination (hence my difficulty choosing an appropriate verb).

That was the canonical way, I believe

That was probably on tablets with a touch screen, similar to how Android users swipe down from the top. But most definitely not with the touchpad on a laptop.
It was almost impossible to work on the laptop because the charms bar would pop up every time you want to move your cursor to the left. Until I disabled that setting in the touch driver setting. For those with a computer mouse or similar pointing device, you had to move the mouse to one of the corners.

And then you could have had the option to pin app icons to it! And lots of other third-party things would have finagled their way into the TDBN box!
We still have some 2012 servers hanging around and I go onto them just infrequently enough to spend a happy few moments clicking the taskbar Windows icon, then the Desktop panel, then the Windows icon, before I remember the way to actually get at the apps I need. Grrr ‚Ä¶
