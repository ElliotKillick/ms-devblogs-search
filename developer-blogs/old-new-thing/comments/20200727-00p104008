The JavaScript example seems a bit weird. `array.splice(0, 0, a, b, c)` does the same as `array.unshift(a, b, c)` (which is shorter) â€“ inserting the elements at the start of the array (not removing anything). You could also do `array.push(a, b, c)` to insert at the end instead. If you wanted to replace the contents, youâ€™d need to write `array.splice(0, array.length, a, b, c)`.

being unable to use collection initializer syntax to assign a collection in C# is a little annoying but can work around it by creating a struct that take a collection as an argument to its constructor and initializes a property to that collection and then use a collection initializer on that property and it just works  cause it actually just calls add for each value in the initializer, after the constructor is called
Something like this for the struct

            collectioninit<List<int>> cl = new collectioninit<List<int>>(list)
            {
                collection = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 },
    

            };

        Console.WriteLine(string.Join(",",list)); // prints 0,1,2,3,4

Really not something i would rely on to work and wouldnâ€™t use it in any sort of production code.

You just replaced `list = new List{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 }` which is 37 characters long with a 102 character long monstrosity where I have to look up the struct definition to understand what it is doing.
So yeah, please donâ€™t use that one in production code or anywhere else except for obfuscation contests ðŸ˜‰
