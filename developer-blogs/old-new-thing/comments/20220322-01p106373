The obvious (to me) answer is the Goldberg Variations. It's exactly the sort of piece a pianist would obsess over and make a career out of playing all by itself, and if you had a novel and brilliant interpretation you could definitely get paid to play it forever without people thinking it was all _that_ weird. If Glenn Gould had never played anything other than the Goldberg Variations, he would probably be more famous, not less.
This does raise the question of "what is a piece?". Do Bach's 6 cello suites count as "a piece"? If so, it's another good candidate....Read moreThe obvious (to me) answer is the Goldberg Variations. It‚Äôs exactly the sort of piece a pianist would obsess over and make a career out of playing all by itself, and if you had a novel and brilliant interpretation you could definitely get paid to play it forever without people thinking it was all _that_ weird.

This does raise the question of ‚Äúwhat is a piece?‚Äù. Do Bach‚Äôs 6 cello suites count as ‚Äúa piece‚Äù? If so, it‚Äôs another good candidate. If not, why not? What about the Goldberg Variations? The WTC? The four books of Alb√©niz‚Äô Iberia? The three books of the Ann√©es de P√®lerinage? The Art of the Fugue? Chopin √âtudes? Just Op. 10 or 25, or both combined? The Nocturnes? Do Beethoven‚Äôs Op. 27 sonatas or Op. 18 quartets count as a single piece? All 18 of Brahms Intermezzi? Just the Op. 117 ones? All six works in Op. 118? Some of these seem clearer than others.
That said, despite the possible fame and fortune and the tempting ability to play a piece as well as it can possibly be played, there‚Äôs no way I would ever accept this tradeoff. I would not enjoy being tied to a single piece of music for so long ‚Äî I much prefer being able to develop a close relationship with one piece and then move on to another one (I‚Äôm on a multiyear journey with Chopin‚Äôs Op. 58 right now), and even though I could never play it to a level where it would attract audiences, I‚Äôm quite content with my life as it is. And if I had to accept the tradeoff, I would pick a piece that is open to a wide range of interpretation (e.g., Goldberg Variations, Bach Cello Suites, or something by Hindemith) rather than one that is merely insanely difficult or beautiful ‚Äî assuming that this curse still allowed me to play with my interpretation over the years and that I‚Äôm not fixed to a particular way of playing it.
If, however, you offered me the ability to frictionlessly play one piece per year with a brilliant interpretation, and during that year I could play no other piece‚Ä¶ I might accept _that_ offer, though I‚Äôd want at least a couple of weeks of struggle to get to that point to really make it worthwhile (I think I would be quite dissatisfied if it really came with no effort at all). In this scenario, I probably wouldn‚Äôt go on tour ‚Äî I think I prefer being a software developer to a performer, but I‚Äôd be very pleased with myself and would definitely play it for friends and share it on the internet. In fact, this is not far from my current life, if you replace ‚Äúfrictionlessly‚Äù and ‚Äúwith a brilliant interpretation‚Äù with ‚Äúto a mediocre, but listenable level‚Äù.
I often used to think about these sorts of Cassandra-like super powers with a curse. One that really stuck with me was: what would it be like if you could understand every human in every language perfectly, but no one could understand you at all in any language?

I would play the salpinx (a bronze trumpet with a bone mouthpiece), preferably the fifth, sixth, or seventh one.  There would only ever be one performance, and yet my musical career would still last for as long as everyone‚Äôs lifetime.

As a non-musical person, I already have the downside, so it would be quite amazing to be able to play anything to the level of the question.
I would think that the longest possible piece, that is also pleasing to the audience, would be best to achieve the longest career.  If you could perform for two hours or more, then you wouldn‚Äôt need anything else.  You tour on your breathtaking, tear inducing version of ___ and so long as you were willing to go to cities of even moderate size around the world, you could probably tour indefinitely.

The ‚Äúpleasing to the audience‚Äù part is important there. There‚Äôs a performance of John Cage‚Äôs Organ¬≤/ASLSP currently underway that is slated to last for 639 years (https://universes.art/en/specials/john-cage-organ-project-halberstadt). But I don‚Äôt think you could make a career out of it‚Ä¶

Any Harry Partch piece on any Harry Partch-constructed instrument.

That would be strange (and wonderful) enough that nobody would notice if there were only one tune.
