I consider myself a seasoned programmer, yet I‚Äôve caught myself wishing to ‚Äúunring the bell‚Äù on occasion. A silly notion of course, for the reasons you mentioned, but it shows how disconnected from reality/intuition UIs can be sometimes.
The only real solution would be to implement some sort of version control on UI operations, so the user could rollback the sorting and then merge manually the new additions. Imagine the support tickets‚Ä¶

Personally, I would add the original sort sequence to the lParam for each item in the list.  Then it would be easy to restore by ‚Äúsorting‚Äù on the original item order.  It isn‚Äôt built-in (though one more integer probably wouldn‚Äôt blow anyone‚Äôs memory away) so as so often happens, that part of the code is left out of the control and made the customer‚Äôs (in this case, the programmer using the control) responsibility, and every programmer will find a different way to solve it, each with their own (potential) bugs.  At least it keeps things interesting.  üôÇ

Off-topic, but just to say thanks for your blog post from 11 years ago, which was really helpful to me today: Reading the output of a command into a batch file variable.
