Reminds me of recorded messages when I call a service saying "please pay attention to the menu numbers as they have recently changed". Got that same message maybe 12 months apart from one of my banks - those menu numbers were the same both times. 99% of people don't call enough to know the numbers ahead of time, so the message doesn't help. And someone who calls enough to know the menu choices is going to very quickly learn the numbers are changed and adapt anyway.

My Health fund website, just yesterday, has the message on its login page saying “new login process as of August 2023” like that’s still relevant to make everyone use an extra click on every login / visit.
Product names saying “new”… Eventually they’re not the new way. Same with files saying “final” in the file name – unless it’s literally something you’re about to submit and cannot change (and I’d argue “as submitted” is still a better suffix) then inevitably there’s going to be a “final 2” or “really final” file there too.

Re a MediaWiki “blame” tool: The Wikimedia Foundation has developed multiple tools with functionality like that, but they all appear to be rather complicated, and I’m not sure how amenable they are to self-hosting for your own private wiki. Search [mediawiki blame] for specifics.

The various “blame” utilities are nice, but it’s also not that hard to manually perform a binary search on the page history.

Yeah, a long long time ago, I created my own blame tool, working on a page history export from MediaWiki (use [[Special:Export]]): https://github.com/mormegil-cz/mwtools/tree/master/PageBlame

> Is there some wiki blame command that lets you see who last changed a sentence in a MediaWiki wiki?
WikiBlame is your friend

Soooooo what point in time does The Old New Thing refer to? 🙂

I would say, relative time references are a nuisance, but what really drives me nuts is articles / (product) docs where there is no absolute reference in time whatsoever.
You get a link to an interesting article and there is zero inline or header information WHEN that article has been written or published.
Then you have to go around fishing in metadata or using the Wayback Machine to find out when that particular piece of info first appeared.
Happens WAY too often. 🙂

This reminds me of your previous post, 'On the dangers of giving a product feature the name “new”', where various commenters gave examples of things called "New" that, well, aren't new any more.
My favourite of the list is from Daniel Rose - a part of Germany with the "alte Neubaugebiet" and "neue Neubaugebiet" - or "old new development area" and "new new development area". But there's also things like New College (one of the oldest colleges in Oxford, where 75% of Oxford colleges are newer than New College), and the Altneu Schul (old-new synagogue), which got renamed because it was...Read moreThis reminds me of your previous post, ‘On the dangers of giving a product feature the name “new”’, where various commenters gave examples of things called “New” that, well, aren’t new any more.

Yeah, never name something “new”… it’s the most reliable way possible of guaranteeing it will linger long after it should have been killed off.

Something else I’ve noticed in long-term documentation is that if the current description has evolved significantly the documentation may mostly describe the changes, e.g. “you should use Foo instead of Bar to Baz.” This is probably useful when the changes were recently implemented, but if you arrive after the evolutionary stage has completed the documentation can be hard to understand because you as the reader lack the context of the older version.

I love wrestling with a particularly old and convoluted piece of code that’s still called “NewSomething”

It probably references a function called “FooExEx3” as well, which should actually now be “Foo4” since some refactoring that happened a decade ago.

Funny timing on this post, because I was just thinking about the same subject at work today, updating some older documentation. Ended up using phrases like “As of writing (Jan 2025), …” all over the place… a little clumsy, bit effective enough.

I have a rule that I bring out when doing code reviews: Flag every use of the words “now” or “new” (the latter especially in names of files, classes, functions, etc. when someone is trying to contrast the way the stuff they’re adding with the stuff that’s already there).
Trivia: New College, founded 1379, at the University of Oxford is the most extreme example that I know of demonstrating how using “new” can get you into trouble 🙂
