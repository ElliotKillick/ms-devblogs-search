The analogy in this post, I’m afraid, is flawed. Landowners do not lose their ownership of their lands when a building on the land gets demolished. And even though you might hear the term “that house is sold”, it is, in fact, the land that is sold.
I’m not sure why you tried to explain things with a real-world analogy. The title already scares away anyone not familiar with the subject.

Some people really do own the house but not the land. Said people are generally up for a bad time.

Yup.
Technically all land deeds in Hong Kong will expire on 2047, and this had caused some problem with banks on mortgage, and the government “land auction”.

And then we get into the matter of the file deletion example not working because of the file swap trick… Possibly.

Raymond, the old links from blogs.msdn.microsoft.com (and probably the variant with the msdn.com one) is broken.
