Another interesting twist that went England's way is the catch close to the boundary at the 48th over. It was caught but the fielder stepped on the rope so the batsman was not out and 6 runs was awarded.
Had the New Zealand fielder (Boult) not held on to the ball as he was stepping backwards to the rope, but deflected it in midair to the other fielder (Guptill) and Guptill caught it, Stokes would have been out (he was the established batsman), England would not get any runs, they would be 8 wickets down, have two new batsmen with...Read moreAnother interesting twist that went England’s way is the catch close to the boundary at the 48th over.

I am guessing the Kiwis could relate to Roger Federer after loss.
It also showed the classy side of Cricket, as Guptill immediately signalled six to the umpire.
In a way, Cricket is my Old New Thing. Growing up in Kolkata (India), I watched, and played Cricket casually. Then 14 years ago, I moved to Canada and stopped following it completely. The last match I remember watching was two World Cups ago in 2011 when India won. This world cup got me back into following Cricket and India team through the World Cup. It was a dissapointing loss for India but I enjoyed watching it and sharing the excitement with my son. It was refreshing to watch a low scoring semi-finals game with the added drama of rain delays and Duckworth-Lewis-Stern coming into consideration [perhaps a future blog for you :)].
It was a pleasure to read about Cricket from you. Thank you.

The cricket world has always been extremely stats-heavy, moreso than any other European sport that I know of (I suspect baseball is pretty similar in North America). One of the earliest web sites I remember using, back in the days when there weren’t many to choose from, was CricInfo, launched in March 1993. It was basically a massive cricket stats database. It was acquired by ESPN and is now called ESPNcricinfo (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPNcricinfo).
In those days, a surfing session was either that, the CIA World Fact Book or HampsterDance.

Some of the rules of cricket are so arcane, even the umpires on the field for the world cup final (supposedly the two best umpires in the world) got it wrong: the situation you mentioned where the deflection off the batsman caused an additional four runs to be awarded - this gave England a total of 6 runs for the ball, which was actually incorrect. Under the laws of the game, you only take runs already completed *at the time the fielder last touches the ball prior to it crossing the boundary* and add four to that total. Instead, the...Read moreSome of the rules of cricket are so arcane, even the umpires on the field for the world cup final (supposedly the two best umpires in the world) got it wrong: the situation you mentioned where the deflection off the batsman caused an additional four runs to be awarded – this gave England a total of 6 runs for the ball, which was actually incorrect. Under the laws of the game, you only take runs already completed *at the time the fielder last touches the ball prior to it crossing the boundary* and add four to that total. Instead, the way it was handled was treated as *the number of runs completed at the time the ball crossed the boundary*.
This turned out to be critical in the game as, had it been awarded as 5 instead of 6, the other (far less skilled) batsman from England would have had to face the last ball, and England would have needed 3 from it instead of 2. Very likely, this would have been a New Zealand victory instead of an England one. 
The only thing the New Zealand team can say is “well, I guess that particular mistake will never happen again”, because that rule is now planted solidly into the minds of every player and umpire as a result of this umpiring mistake in the world cup final.

According to this copy of the laws, the batting team is credited for "the runs completed by the batsmen, together with the run in progress if they had already crossed at the instant of the throw or act." I rewatched the video, and it appears that they had not yet crossed at the time of the throw, so even with this more generous allowance, it seems that the extra run was improperly awarded. But what do I know. I just started watching this game. (Baseball has a similar technicality, where some awards are based on the runners' locations at the...Read moreAccording to this copy of the laws, the batting team is credited for “the runs completed by the batsmen, together with the run in progress if they had already crossed at the instant of the throw or act.” I rewatched the video, and it appears that they had not yet crossed at the time of the throw, so even with this more generous allowance, it seems that the extra run was improperly awarded.

Re bonus chatter: New Zealand "lost 8 wickets" and hence were 241/8 at the end of their 50 overs (or 8/241 in Australia which does things backwards). England were 241 "all out". Even more unusually, England tied the match and were all out on the last ball of their innings (in cricket "innings" is always plural).
Maybe also relevant are the conventions about describing the victory margin ("by 'x' runs" if the first team batting wins, "by 'y' wickets" if the team batting second ["chasing"] wins). But again not relevant to this match because it was a tie settled by countback.

If England had made 242 on the last ball of their innings, would they have been described as winning by 1 wicket despite a) losing more wickets than New Zealand b) remaining wickets not actually affecting the result in any way, except to cause the innings to end before 50 overs have been bowled?

In short: yes. It's because the number of wickets remaining isn't important for scoring that a team can be described as winning by one wicket even if they lost more wickets - you're not competing against the other team's wicket count, you're competing againt their effort to get all of your wickets.
In the original long-format game, there is no restriction on the number of overs, so the number of wickets the second team has left is the best indication of how close the game was; if they only had one wicket left then it was very close indeed. For limited-overs...Read moreIn short: yes.

For limited-overs matches, this isn’t really sufficient – you know that if they only had one wicket left it was definitely close, but what if they won off the last ball with 8 wickets left? That was also pretty close. So for limited overs matches it’s common (but not universal) to also indicate how far through the alloted overs they were, e.g. “won by 2 wickets (with 32 balls remaining)”, or “won by 5 wickets (37.3 overs)”.
