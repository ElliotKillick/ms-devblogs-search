This somehow doesn’t feel quite as black and white as the other examples in this category.
After all, preventing this is kind of the reason we need both username and password and systems preventing duplicate usernames even if passwords wouldn’t match since passwords can indeed coincidentally match.
The issue is that in this case the system assumes that Administrator@machine1 is the same username as Administrator@machine2.. I have always found it strange that I open RDP connection and log in to the remote machine using LOCAL\username – not having to write REMOTE\username

Let's say that the domain administrator didn't follow the best practices, so that it was indeed possible for the scenario mentioned in the report to happen.
Further, let's say that the domain administrator and the local administrator are both the sort of people whose luggage combination is 12345, whose ATM PIN is 1234, and whose password is Pa$$word1. (It would be password, but complexity requirements, you know.)
Now you have a collision that didn't require either of the people involved to know the other's password, or really even to know much beyond how to keep breathing.
It's highly improbable that such a password...Read moreLet’s say that the domain administrator didn’t follow the best practices, so that it was indeed possible for the scenario mentioned in the report to happen.

It’s highly improbable that such a password collision could occur randomly if passwords were actually random, but is it impossible?

The same logic can be applied to password guessing. No need for domains or account collision here. Even with truly random passwords, it’s still possible to guess them by chance. What saves us from that is precisely that it is highly improbable.

"What saves us from that is precisely that it is highly improbable."
That reminds me of something from quantum mechanics - namely, the fact that an electron needs to get all of the energy required to move it to a higher energy state from a single photon.
From what I've read, there is theoretically nothing preventing an electron from absorbing energy from multiple photons. However, the probability of it being hit by even one photon is already quite low, and the chances of it getting hit by another photon before dropping back to a lower energy state are so small that it's...Read more“What saves us from that is precisely that it is highly improbable.”

(Once again, this is just my understanding – happy to be corrected if I’m wrong!)

The difference is one of intent. If you’re trying to guess passwords, you know you’re trying to guess passwords. If you accidentally end up logged in as a domain admin because you connected to the wrong machine, you might not know you’ve even done so until you’ve ended up somewhere you shouldn’t have and caused irreparable damage.
