The tab background is styled, e.g. with a fancy color gradient on Windows XP. Not obeying the sibling principle or screwing up the Z order leads to problems: Obvious ones like controls not redrawing properly, but also pretty weird ones like the tab background becoming a blocky low-resolution version of the gradient, as even better seen here.
So the really interesting question becomes: How do controls inside of tabs draw their background?
They cannot request the background brush from their parent, as the parent is just the main window.

That would be a very nice follow-up blog post.
Over the years I solved the issue of gradient background in a several different ways.
But I always wondered what’s the proper way, i.e. how the PropertySheet common dialog does it.

But why was it designed this way? WS_TABSTOP already existed when WS_EX_CONTROLPARENT was added and it would be natural for both styles to be set for the tab control.
In Delphi and their VCL wrappers around the WinApi, the tab control is actually the parent.
