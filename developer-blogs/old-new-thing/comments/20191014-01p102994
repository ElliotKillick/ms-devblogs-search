I know very little about rugby, but here’s an interesting fact: the ‘try’ is called a ‘try’ because originally there were no points awarded for touching the ball to the ground beyond the opponent’s goal line. The only value in doing so was that you then got to attempt (or ‘try’) to kick a conversion goal. It was only some time later that tries scored points in themselves, even without the conversion.

And the 22m line is so placed because it was converted from 25 yards.  (the pitch was originally 110 yards, now 100m)

Minor nitpick:  “If three or more players contest a ball while standing, it is a maul.” is not the definition of a maul, otherwise the ball carrier and two defenders trying to tackle him would be a maul and the tacklers would not be allowed to bring the ball carrier to ground (penalty for collapsing the maul).  The vital missing piece is it’s the ball carrier (or the ball on the ground by itself in the case of a ruck) and at least one member from each team.

Bonus fact: USA are the current Olympics Gold Medalists for Rugby, having won the Gold medal in 1924, the last time full team rugby was played at the Olympics (now it is Rugby Sevens).
