> S-1-15-2-2: All Restricted Application Packages
> I’m not sure what this means or how it differs from All Application Packages.
Now you got us curious. Maybe your friends from Microsoft know, call them for help.

“ALL RESTRICTED APPLICATION PACKAGES” is for all less privileged AppContainers (LPACs). Those are AppContainers that get even less permissions by default, which were introduced in Windows 10 version 1703.
The old Microsoft Edge used LPACs for its sandboxed processes, and they are being explored as well for Chromium-based browsers like Google Chrome, new Edge, Brave, etc. Unfortunately, LPACs have virtually no documentation from Microsoft itself, but if you search the web for "chromium sandbox" you can read the design doc for Chrome's Windows sandboxing, which includes a good description of LPACs.

The best SIDs are 6581 and, to a lesser extent, 8580.

This is similar to how scheduled tasks will run under a virtual user account based on the service name (i.e. NT TASK\[Task name]). The SID of this virtual account is dynamically generated based on a hash of the task name, and runs under the `S-1-5-87` authority. This is why you can't rename or move existing scheduled tasks - it would change the SID and all the security settings you've deployed. You can generate the sid of any arbitrary task name by running:

SUCCESS: The SID "S-1-5-87-2634381056-3711325779-3967898769-4058759293-3493767943" for the user name "Contoso-The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog" has been computed successfully.
Services have a similar idea. Services can run under a *”virtual service account’* based on the name of the service (e.g. NT SERVICE\MSSQLSERVER). And the user’s SID is based on the hash of the service name, and is issued under the `S-1-5-80` authority. You can generate the SID of an arbitrary service name using:
>sc showsid "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"
SERVICE SID: S-1-5-80-2312335432-65297056-3549082870-2589977271-250352331
STATUS: Inactive
And IIS has the same thing for application pools. They run as a virtual user named `IIS APPPOOL\[App Pool Name]`, with an SID issued under the `S-1-5-82` authority, and based on the hash of the name of the application pool.
