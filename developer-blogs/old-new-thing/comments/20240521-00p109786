“As a painful reminder of this error condition, the scanner was mounted on a World War II infantry helmet and worn by one of the engineering managers to the War Room meetings for the remainder of the project.”
I want to see a picture of that!

I have an image in my head of the cart-of-death. I must have just pictured it from the 15 year old blog post and the part in the book, and forgot that is wasn’t real.

Hi Raymond — Love the blog! Were both YouTube links meant to point to the same video from Dave’s Garage? Additional correction, I believe that USB power request is supposed be “500mA” and not “mW”.

USB 1.0 / 1.1 allowed bus-powered devices to draw up to 100mA at 5V, or 500mW. Support for negotiating up to 500mA would only be added with USB 2.0 in 2000, whereas the demo took place in 1998.

USB 1.1 (I've not looked at USB 1.0) has the same power levels as USB 2.0 - you can draw up to 100 mA at 5V as soon as you're connected, and once you're granted permission, you can draw up to 500 mA. When you're in suspend and set as a remote wakeup source, you can draw 1/200th of the power you're allowed when not in suspend; if you're in suspend, but not remote wakeup, then you're limited to 0.5 mA.

This is described in chapter 7 of USB 1.1; it’s not completely clear (unlike USB 2.0) about how you get permission to draw up to 500 mA, but it does say (in chapter 10) that if you offer a configuration descriptor that says you’ll draw more power, and the host selects that configuration, then you are allowed to draw more power.
The only significant change between USB 1.1 and USB 2.0 is that USB 1.1 hosts tended to be harsher on devices that drew more current than permitted, where by the time USB 2.0 came around, most hosts pretty much allowed 500 mA from the get-go even though they could be stricter.

Wow now we have an actual picture of the cart of death! I remembered that you mentioned about the Cart of Death in your interview with Dave Plummer.
