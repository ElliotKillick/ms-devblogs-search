I was thinking that to reboot a mouse one has simply to unplug and reinsert the USB connector. About rebooting stuff I still have a VHS recorder bought in the '90s, and in the instruction manual, that of course is a paper manual there are instructions to reboot it in case it acts weird, basically unplug from the mains, wait two minutes and plug it back: so isn't actually a new thing having to reboot household items. The problem of today is that you don't get a decent instruction manual anymore, and in a lot of cases the one you...Read moreI was thinking that to reboot a mouse one has simply to unplug and reinsert the USB connector.

By the way I followed the link about Macintosh USB floppy drives, and I was expecting something about MFM/GCR dual mode for the Mac version to read older 800K Mac floppies)

Cheers. This reminded me I need to buy a burner toothbrush to unclog the top speaker of my smart phone.

It’s clear you never had the “pleasure” to have to reboot a sex toy, probably the last thing on anyone’s mind in the heat of the moment…

I guess, sometimes an electric toothbrush counts as one. It just depends on who’s the actual user. And with bad cooling it might even add a lot to ”the heat of the moment”, I guess.

I recently had to reboot my laptop’s charger by unplugging it from the wall. No, I could not unplug it from and replug it in to the laptop. No, a different laptop from the same manufacturer didn’t work. The charger itself had hung and had to be power cycled.

Just yesterday, my electric toothbrush - a Waterpik Sensonic - locked up. Quite literally - if I pushed the power button, the LEDs would flash briefly, it would make a small "clunk" sound, and it would shut off again.
Upon examination, I found a tiny Phillips-head screw in the center of the alignment hole where it sits on the wireless charger. Removing that screw allowed me to pop the bottom of the handle off, whereupon a coil attached by painfully thin wires fell into my hand. From there, I had to gently pry a couple of little plastic tabs away...Read moreJust yesterday, my electric toothbrush – a Waterpik Sensonic – locked up.

Upon examination, I found a tiny Phillips-head screw in the center of the alignment hole where it sits on the wireless charger. Removing that screw allowed me to pop the bottom of the handle off, whereupon a coil attached by painfully thin wires fell into my hand. From there, I had to gently pry a couple of little plastic tabs away from the outer shell while pressing on the brush end, and the entire guts of the thing came out of the handle. When it was out of the handle, I pushed the power button and it did exactly what it was supposed to do. So, being a software developer at heart, I just put it back together to see if the problem happened again, and it did not.
I’m still not entirely sure what happened, but I’d guess that there was some mineral buildup in the brush end keeping it from vibrating, and the vibrating mechanism was drawing too much current, causing it to shut down. Popping the guts out of it must have jostled that free.

As a seasoned toothbrush mechanic, let me set it straight. Just like how you’d never skip on oil changes for your car if you want it to last, you can’t ignore regular maintenance for your toothbrush. We’re talking about bristle alignments, plaque filter replacements, and keeping that battery in top condition. The last thing you need is a sonic bristle blow out at 25,000 strokes per minute.

Maybe you’re holding it wrong.

Are you sure you rebooted it instead of hibernating? You have to do a hard reboot.

Or have you tried booting it in safe mode?  Sometimes third-party drivers or AV software can cause problems with booting your toothbrush.

Hi, I am a Microsoft MVP and I would be happy to help you. Please try runing sfc /scannow on your toothbrush. If that doesn’t work, reinstall Microsoft Windows for Toothbrushes (R)
