Does that mean windows class names are part of the public API surface of a GUI app?

For the most part, NO! For example, APIs related to the taskbar do FindWindow+SendMessage but those are internal details, just use the documented functions. For automation, use MSAA/UI Automation.
Of course 3rd-party apps may use their class as part of the API. The most popular mp3 player back in the day had a public SDK where the class name was part of the API and there were/are messages to send for play/pause/next/isplaying/getlength etc. But it has its downsides if you don't plan well.

2) They added a switch to use a custom class name. I think this was to allow multiple instances in some sort of DJ mode but also breaks people looking for the class name.

“if they see a window whose class name is CabinetWClass” Explorer used to be pretty special, use the /e switch and the Explorer window would change its window class. Why, I don’t actually know. I assume for compatibility but that does not make much sense either because even without the folder tree, a Win95 cabinet window is very different from what came before (ListView or even a custom NSE with custom controls).

I don’t think I’ve ever seen a capital Eth before.

That brings me to the next question: Why is it best practice to use a translatable resource to store the windowclass name?

I just argued that they shouldn’t.

Shouldn’t be changed or shouldn’t be stored in a resource?  That then begs the question, why does the Windows Desktop project template do it that way?

Maybe to make them easier to change in case of compatibility problems or whatnot?
