I think a denial of service bug might be worth a bounty, while an ordinary bug likely isn’t.
Look for the money.

Give me a NULL pointer deference and I can move the Earth – Archimedes
NULL pointer (and similar) dereferences are perfectly exploitable.  Heres an example, picking on Windows specifically for that case but it works just as well for Unix systems.

As noted in the article itself, null pointer mapping attacks haven’t worked since Windows 8. Furthermore, the attack described in the article is a user-to-kernel attack. But the attack described here is user-to-user, so even on Windows 7, exploiting it means that you must first gain remote code execution in the victim process in order to map the null page. “Remote code execution leads to remote code execution” is not an interesting vulnerability.

The last one’s status as even just a bug is questionable. It’s not “the program is doing something wrong” as much as “the program is not working the way I think it should” which doesn’t matter much if the developers think it should work that way. And it’s not even clear how he thinks it should work. Should Windows yell at you if you select an image file that has potential problems, or should it just go ahead and try to do its best to load it?

An old adage says “a bug is just a feature that is not documented”. If something works according to documentation, you can not say it is a bug. “Garbage in, garbage out” is one of the clearest cases. So I agree, that can’t be counted as a bug.

Probable real vulnerability: memory bomb. Only applicable on terminal server.

Even then, not guaranteed to be a vulnerability. Most terminal servers have some concept of memory quota – last time I looked, Windows did “fair share” quotas, where each user was allowed an equal amount of memory.
So your memory bomb only affects you, and no-one else.

I guess any bug can be viewed as a “denial of service” attack. “How dare this app not behave as I wish!”
