Can you tell from the debugging information (winrt::Contoso::implementation::Sample, winrt::Contoso::ISample) for the dumped pointer what the offset is? In particular, can you get the debugger to cast the pointer to the base class that the pointed-at vtable is for to the derived class to get it to reverse the offset, or is it not clever enough?

Personally I’d try just asking the object where it starts. Time to check out vtable slot negative one and poke at the RTTI structs! If you can guess which RTTI standard is being used, you can just grab the complete object locator and do a dynamic cast yourself. A bit complicated, but that’s what automation is for.
