Thank you so much, Raymond Chen, for an extremely helpful and motivating post!
In late 2023 I got a HP that lasted about 6 months before the display matrix broke and a little over 1/3 of the screen was unusable. I don't know what the reason is - it hasn't been hit, it hasn't overheated, I only know that it's not my first laptop whose life ends so ingloriously. I don't know how it is in the United States, but in our country, the service is under all criticism. It is cheaper and with less wasted nerves to buy something new.

In late 2023 I got a HP that lasted about 6 months before the display matrix broke and a little over 1/3 of the screen was unusable. I don‚Äôt know what the reason is ‚Äì it hasn‚Äôt been hit, it hasn‚Äôt overheated, I only know that it‚Äôs not my first laptop whose life ends so ingloriously. I don‚Äôt know how it is in the United States, but in our country, the service is under all criticism. It is cheaper and with less wasted nerves to buy something new.
Well, last summer I bought an Asus. The only thing I‚Äôm happy with was the order and delivery ‚Äì completely online. It didn‚Äôt come with the OS ordered, nor was there any information about what components were in it. Subsequently, it turned out that some of the components inside do not correspond to those that Asus offers in the international market. Two weeks of unsuccessful attempts to install Windows on it. In the end, they installed it for me at the local dealership, for a fee, of course. I have been actively working with this OS since versions 95/NT 4. I have sporadic encounters with versions 3.xx. I have never been unable to install an operating system. But when only the dealer knows what‚Äôs inside the black box that I‚Äôm not allowed to open, otherwise the warranty goes to hell, one simply has no choice.
Anyway, I was able to put in a Windows 11, the dealer rep added the missing drivers (at least some of them, I don‚Äôt know if all of them yet). The laptop worked for a month, a month and a half, and then stopped ‚Äì it just does not turn on and does not charge. I admit that electronics and hardware are not my forte. At home, I don‚Äôt change more than a light bulb, and not just any light bulb. I contacted the dealer representative in my city. From there they replied that there was nothing they could do, I had to send it to the local Asus representative located in the capital. They might as well have told me to send it to New Zealand or the Ivory Coast. And if it‚Äôs trade and service‚Ä¶
I was desperate, since August last year this laptop has been sitting untouched, waiting for an unknown what. Until I read your post, from three days ago. A quick internet search, two clips, one of which is in a language I don‚Äôt understand and, oh my goodness, I was able to turn it on today. I don‚Äôt know how long it will work yet, but you and other people I don‚Äôt know personally have given me back my faith that there is still someone out there who cares.

There are several proven methods to update ASUS laptop BIOS without a working battery:
Method 1: Using EZ Flash with "risky" Bypass
Download the BIOS update file and copy it to a FAT32-formatted USB drive
Boot into BIOS by holding F2 while powering on the laptop
Navigate to EZ Flash utility in BIOS
When you get the battery warning message, simply type "risky" on your keyboard
Method 2: F11 Key Method
If the "risky" method doesn't work, you can try the F11 key method:
Boot into BIOS and open EZ Flash
Press and hold F11 while selecting the BIOS file

Can we mention that it‚Äôs worth double checking the hole has a switch under it rather than say a microphone, speaker etc before shoving a paperclip in it üôÇ

hah. that would be unfortunate.
I always assume long-press on the power button would do the trick, and it seems like it does.
