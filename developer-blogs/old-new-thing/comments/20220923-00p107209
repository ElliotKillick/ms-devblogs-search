When explorer.exe isn’t running as the taskbar shell, all shell namespace updates cease because the taskbar unnecessarily hosts the relayer. I would rather get spammed than have nothing at all. Every file manager window just sits there without the updates, unless we wire up ReadDirectoryChangesW and a bunch of other functions too but then we’re just recreating the namespace.
