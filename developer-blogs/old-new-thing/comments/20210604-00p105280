I’m surprised that the division instructions don’t provide the remainder in any way.  From some quick googling, it looks like if you want to calculate a % b, you either have to compute a – (a / b) * b or use some bit twiddling or other arithmetic hacks if b is a known compile-time constant.

Thanks to the multiply subtract instruction, it is just one extra instruction after division to get the remainder:

# Calculate r0 % r1
sdiv    r3, r0, r1
mls     r0, r3, r1, r0
