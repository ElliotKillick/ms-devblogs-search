From a different point of view, the security vulnerability threat is rather real and scaring, although Microsoft is not to blame. Hiring trustworthy admins is not a trivial task and unfortunately nothing Microsoft could fix with a software patch. Instead of asserting Microsoft’s innocence, how about telling customers, that this is the reason why admins need to be treated well?

It seems like you have somewhat mixed feelings about whether or not this is a security bug giving that you decide to redact the full reg key path.

Raymond is just abiding by his own ground rules for the blog. You can find the “ground rules” link on the main page for the blog.

I don’t see mixed feelings here.
First of all, the redaction was probably just to anonymize the report even more when talking about it publicly.
Second of all, which specific registry key it is in question doesn’t actually matter. The whole point is that the registry tree under HKLM is writable only to Administrators by default, so for someone to be able to change that setting, they must either have or have had Administrator access.

I got CVE-2015-2552 for a Unicode handling bug to enable driver test signing mode with Secure Boot enabled.  It required write access to Boot Configuration Database (“BCD”), so it definitely was on the other side of the airtight hatchway, and yet was considered a security bug.
It really depends on what you consider a security boundary.

It's getting even weirder these days, because people who don't understand security are issuing security warnings for non-things.
The contrived example is:
- Run Word
- Open a Word document
- The user can then see the contents of the Word document
To those of us who have been dealing with security boundaries, permissions, and ACLs in Windows since 1994 this sounds silly.
But people now have it in their head that no program should be allowed to open anything on the user's PC.
Because of phones.

- the app cannot open files

The Windows security boundaries and security features (as well as whether Microsoft intends to address it via a security update instead of a feature update) are described in Microsoft Security Servicing Criteria for Windows.  Your scenario sounds like it breached the Secure Boot security goal described there.

I seem to recall a wise old system administrator who told a young admin “With great power comes great responsibility.”

You would probably not be surprised how many people think it’s a security problem that the local administrator has the power to trample upon group policy.
