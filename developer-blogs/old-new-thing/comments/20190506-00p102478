I am a newbie regarding git. Can you provide images or a graphical representation of what you are doing? Thanks.

That is very clever. I‚Äôll give this a try and see how I feel about it. Just curious, is there something this process accomplishes that a ff merge from private to public followed by a soft reset for squash would not accomplish? Feels like I might be missing something üôÇ
Your method is fewer conceptual steps, and is definitely cooler.

I was thinking something similar (why not just squash merge?) and I think I got the answer from today's post:

Right, the magic here is that it doesn‚Äôt touch your working tree. This makes it very fast, and you can do it even if you have uncommitted work in progress.
