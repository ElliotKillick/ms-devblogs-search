This is a bit offtopic here, but is there any way to see any of the comments in old blog entries? These old comments seem to be gone now, but they had quite a lot of discussions that I liked to read back when they still existed. All of this seems to be gone now (also this website seems to be a bit broken on firefox when logged in)

Unfortunately all the old comments were lost when the blog was moved (again) back in March: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20190313-01/?p=102234

Oh, the C++ version of DoEvents().
Btw, I wonder what if the main application create the long running task as delegate, and use the ‚ÄúPlease wait‚Äù dialog to run it in background thread. Would it be better in this way?
